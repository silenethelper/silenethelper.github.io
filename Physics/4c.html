<p><strong>Two wires carrying current in the same direction attract each other. But two beams of electrons traveling in the same direction repel each other. Explain why?</strong></p>
 Ans: The two wires carrying current in the same direction attract each other due to magnetic interaction. Net charge on the current carrying wire is zero and hence there is no electrostatic interaction between the wires. In case of two beams of electrons, electrostatics interaction (repulsive) is much more than the magnetic interaction (attractive). Hence two beams of electrons repel each other. 

<p><strong>When a charged particle moves in a magnetic field, its K.E. remains the same. Explain, why?</strong></p>
  Ans: Force on moving charged particle due to magnetic field is always perpendicular to velocity vector (v). It means, this force does not change the magnitude of velocity and simply changes the direction of motion of the particle i.e. K.E. = mv2 Since speed (v) remains the same so K.E. of the charged particle is not changed. In what respect does a wire carrying a current differ from a wire which carries no current? Ans: In a wire carrying current, there is continuous flow of electrons through a crosssection of wire in a particular direction. A magnetic field is set up around the wire carrying current. In a wire carrying no current. the electrons move at random, and net flow of electrons through a cross-section of the wire is zero. No magnetic field is set up around such wire.

<p><strong>How can we detect whether field is a uniform magnetic field or uniform electric field.</strong></p>
 Ans.  We can detect whether the given field is a niform magnetic field or a uniform electric field by observing the trajectory and measuring the Kinetic energy of the electron beam. If the trajectory of the beam is a parabola and its kinetic energy changes, then the beam is in the electric field. On the other hand if the trajectory of the electron beam is circular and its K.E. remains the same, then the electron is in the
magnetic field. 

<p><strong>Can a uniform magnetic field be used to speed up a charged particle? Explain.</strong></p>
 Ans: The force acting on the moving charged particle in the uniform magnetic field is
    F = q (u x B)  force is always perpendicular to the
    particle and hence no work is done on the sed particle. Now workdone is equal to
    charged particle . As no work is done so change in zero and hence the charged particle eed up although its direction of motion changes by the uniform magnetic field .
  
<p><strong>What is work done by magnetic charged particle moving in it? </strong></p>
Ans: We know, F = q (V*B) Here, F is always perpendicular to v.
So Power, P = Rate of work done = F. V = F v cos 90 = 0 Hence work done by magnetic field on the charged particle moving in it is zero. 

<p><strong>Free electrons always keep on moving in a conductor. But no force acts on them in a magnetic field unless a current is passed through it. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: In the absence of electric current through a conductor, the free electrons are in a state of continues random motion. Therefore they don't have any net velocity in any direction and hence there is no net magnetic force. However, when current flows through a conductor, the free electrons move with a drift velocity in a definite direction. Hence, magnetic force acts on them. 

<p><strong>Does a charged particle moving through magnetic field experience a force? Express with conditions the conditions, maximum, and minimum force it experiences. </strong></p>
Ans: Yes, a charged particle movie magnetic field experiences a force called Lorentz force which can be writt F=B qv sin 0.
charged particle moving through a nces a force. This force can be written as F=BqVsin0
where, B is magnetic flux density, g is is velocity of the charge and o between direction of v and B. This force will be maximum, when e = 90 So maximum force = B qv sin 90° = B. Similarly the force will be minimum. when 0 = 0o.
So minimum force = B q v sin 0 = 0. 12. A proton moving in a straight line
a strong magnetic field along the field direction.

<p><strong>A proton is moving in a straight line enters to a strong magnetic field along the field direction, How will its path and velocity change?</strong></p>
When a proton is moving in a straight line enters to a strong magnetic field along the field direction, then angle between the field and direction of motion of proton is zero. So that Lorentz force, F = Bqv sin 0 is also zero. Hence, path and velocity of the proton will remain unaffected.

<p><strong>What ways electric and magnet fields are different? </strong></p>
Ans: (a) Electric field is produced duet at rest as well as motion, whereas magnetic is generated either due to a magnet ol carrying conductor or a moving charge.
the strength of electric field at decreases with the dielectric mea.
rength of magnetic field increase permeable medium introduced there. (c) The electric lines of force electric field do not form a closed magnetic lines of force form a closed path .

<p><strong>How is magnetic field made radial in a moving coil galvanometer? </strong></p>
Ans: In moving coil galvanometer the coil is suspended between the cylindrical poles of pieces of a strong magnet in such a way that the angle between normal to the plane of coil and direction of magnetic field is 90°. Hence cylindrical pole pieces make the field radial such that sin 0 = 1. So torque = BINA.

<p><strong>Give two factors by which voltagesensitivity of a moving coil galvanometer can be increased.
Ans: The voltage sensitivity of a moving coil galvanometer can be increased by (i) decreasing the torsion constant of the suspension wire and (ii) increasing the number of turns of the galvanometer coil.

<p><strong>Pairs of conductors carrying current into or out of the power supply components of electronic equipments are twisted together. Why?</strong></p>
Ans The coils are non-inductive if two wires are doubly wound on themselves. In this type of a oll, the no. of turns of one is in close contact with the similar turn of the other carrying the Current in opposite direction. The magnetic effect produced in one will almost be neutralized by the other, so that net self-inductance is very small which minimizes the back emf. Due to this reason, pairs of conductors carrying current into or out of power supply components of electronic
equipments are twisted together. 

<p><strong>What is Helmholtz coil?</strong></p>
Ans: Helmholtz found that the magnetic field between the two coaxial parallel coils of equal radius R, separated by a distance R carrying same current in same direction, is uniform which is called Helmholtz coil. 

<p><strong>Hail voltages are much larger for semi-conductors than good conductors for comparable currents, fields and dimensions. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The Hall voltage developed across the specimen carrying a current is given by,
                V =BI/net
where, B = magnetic field, I = current passed and n = no. of electrons (or charge carriers). Since the no. of charge carrier is smaller in semiconductors than the good conductors for the same current and other dimensions, so the Hall
voltage is larger for the semiconductors.
