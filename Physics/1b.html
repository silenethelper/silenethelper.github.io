<p><strong>A restoring force is must for a body to execute S.H.M. Explain, why?</strong></p>
     Ans: For a body to execute S.H.M., it should oscillate about its mean position. When the body is in the mean position, it possesses kinetic energy and by virtue of its motion the body moves from mean position to extreme position. The body can return to the mean position only if it is acted upon by a restoring force.
    
<p><strong>For an oscillating simple pendulum, does the tension in the string remain constant throughout the oscillation? If not, when is it (a) the least (b) the greatest?</strong></p>
Ans: No. The tension is different at different points of oscillation of a simple pendulum. The tension at the extreme point is mg cos e where 18 the deflection of the bob from the vertical. so its maximum value is mg when 0 = 0, i.e. at e equilibrium position. Least value is at the extreme position, where is maximum.

<p><strong>Can simple pendulum experiment be done inside a satellite?</strong></p>
     Ans: The time period of a simple pendulum is given by: T = 2L The body will be in a state of weightlessness inside a satellite so that the effective value of g for it is zero. If g = 0, T is equal to infinity, Hence, the pendulum does not oscillate inside the satellite and the simple pendulum experiment cannot be performed inside a satellite. 

<p><strong>If a pendulum clock is taken to the moon, will it gain or lose time? </strong></p>
 Ans: The time period of a simple pendulum is given by T = 2n Ve where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the earth. This shows that T is inversely proportional to Vg. Since the acceleration due to gravity of the moon is smaller than that of the earth, the period of oscillation of a simple pendulum on

<p><strong>What are the characteristics of simple harmonic motion?</strong></p> Ans: There are following characteristics of simple harmonic motion: (i) It is a periodic motion. (ii) The particle moves to and fro about the
mean position in a straight line. (iii) The acceleration of the particle is
directly proportional to the displacement from mean position, and its direction is opposite to the displacement from the
mean position. 

<p><strong>Why do we say that velocity and acceleration of a body executing S.H.M. are out of phase?</strong></p>
 Ans: When a body is executing S.H.M., at the mean position acceleration is zero and at the extreme positions acceleration is maximum. On the other hand, the velocity is maximum at the mean position and zero at the extreme positions. Further, acceleration is always directed towards the mean position. Due to this reason, the velocity and acceleration of a body executing S.H.M. are out of phase.

<p><strong>What are the drawbacks of simple pendulum?</strong></p>
Ans: Following are the drawbacks of simple
pendulum:
(i) The requirements of an ideal simple pendulum cannot be realised in actual practice i.e. heavy point mass pendulum, weightless and inextensible string is not possible. 
(ii) The motion of the bob is not strictly linear. 
(iii) The resistance and buoyancy of air affects the motion of the bob which is supposed to be negligible. (iv) The amplitude of vibration of the bob may be large. Bob of a simple pendulum is a hollow sphere field with water. 

<p><strong>How will the period of oscillation change if the water begins to drain out of the hollow sphere from a fine hole at its bottom?</strong></p>
Ans: Time period, of oscillation of simple pendulum is T = 2101 Initially, when the sphere is completely filled with water, its C.G. lies at its centre. As water flows out, the C.G. begins to shift below the centre of the sphere. The effective length of the pendulum increases and hence its time period increases. When the sphere becomes more than half empty, its C.G. begins to rise up. The effective length of the pendulum decreases and time period T decreases. When the entire water is drained out of the sphere, the C.G. is once again shifted to centre of the sphere and the time period T attains its initial value.

<p><strong>A body is moving in a circular path with constant speed. Is this motion a simple harmonic? Why?</strong></p> 
Ans: The motion of a body moving in a circular path is periodic. For simple harmonic motion, the motion should be both periodic and oscillatory, 1.e. the body in motion should come at rest momentarily at two extreme position during the motion. Hence the motion of body moving in a circular path with constant speed is periodic but not simple
harmonic.

<p><strong>Explain the soldiers are ordered to break steps while crossing a bridge. </strong></p>
 Ans: Soldiers are ordered to break steps while crossing bridge. If the marching soldiers do not break the steps, the frequency of marching may exactly coincide with the natural frequency of the bridge and the resonance occurs in the bridge, and it vibrates with maximum amplitude. If the displacement of the bridge exceeds the elastic limit of the bridge, it may collapse. So, soldiers are ordered to break steps while
crossing a bridge. 

<p><strong>Simple pendulum clock is assump be better in use as compared to the conical pendulum.Why?</strong></p>
Ans: The time period of oscillation of the
I coso conical pendulum of length 1 is T = 2 root under l/gf g= 0, then it gives the time period of simple pendulum. Hence, in simple pendulum there is one less variable than is conical pendulum, Less the variable, there will be more precise measurement. So, that simple pendulum is widely used in comparison to the conical
pendulum.
