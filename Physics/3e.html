<p><strong>Explain why two flash lights held closed together will not produce an interference pattern on a distance screen?</strong></p>
Ans: An interference pattern is obtained only when the two flash lights is coherent. Two sources of light are said to be coherent if they emit continuous light waves of the same frequency, same wavelength and have zero phase difference or constant phase difference at all times. But it is not possible for two independent sources to be coherent. Hence two flash lights held closed together will not produce an interference pattern on a distant screen. 
    
<p><strong> Can two independent sources of light produce interference?</strong></p>
Ans: No, the two independent sources of light cannot produce sustained interference. For producing interference pattern, we need two coherent sources vibrating in the same phase, or at a constant phase difference. The two independent sources are not coherent hence they can not produce interference. 
    
<p><strong>Why the two sources of light to be close to each other for the production of good interference pattern?</strong></p>
 Ans: For the production of good interference pattern, two sources of light must be close to each other. Because, the fringe width in the interference pattern is inversely proportional to the separation between the coherent sources (ß = 2D/d). When the distance d between the coherent sources is decreased, the fringe width goes on increasing and the clear interference pattern can be observed on the screen. Hence the two sources of light must be close to each other.
    
<p><strong> What will What will happen to the interference of the pattern in Young's experiment, I source is not exactly on the centre in between the slits?</strong></p> 
Ans: In Young's double slit experiment, the source is on the centre line between the slits and the central bright fringe appears at O as shown in Fig. (i). It is because the paths travelled by rays SAO and SBO are equal. If the source is moved upward to the position S, the central bright fringe will appear at O' as shown in Fig. (ii) where the paths of the rays S'AO' and S'BO' are equal. Therefore, when the source is moved upwards from the central line, the central bright fringe will move downwards and vice versa.
    
<p><strong>When two coherent sources are far apart, interference pattern cannot be detected. Why?</strong></p> 
Ans: We know that the fringe width B is inversely proportional to the separation between the sources i.e. B a 1/d. Therefore, when d is increased, the fringe width B goes on decreasing and at very large distance, it becomes undetectable. 
    
<p><strong>What is the effect on the interference fringes in a Young's double slit experiment due to each of the following operations? </strong></p>
(a) The screen is moved away from the plane of the slits. 
(b) The sour is replaced by another source of velength. 
(c) The separation increased shorter wavelength between the two slits is increases

<p><strong>What will happen to the interference fringe obtained in a double slit experiment if the source of light is replaced by other source emitting light of high wave length?</strong></p>
Ans: We know that the fringe width, B = 3 Therefore, the fringe width directly depends upon the wave length of light used. Hence, if we replace the source of light by other source emitting light of higher wave length, then
fringe width will be increased. 

<p><strong>What should be the path difference between two interfering waves for constructive interference and destructive interference? </strong></p>
Ans. In constructive interference, the path difference between two interfering waves should be integral multiple of wavelength. 1, 1.e. X = n2 where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and x is the path difference. In destructive interference, the path difference between two interfering Waves should be an odd half-integral multiple of wavelength a. i.e, 
   
<p><strong>Does the interference of light waves obey the law of conservation of energy? Explain.</strong></p> 
Ans: For a single source of light, the distribution of energy is uniform. But, for two coherent sources, they produce non-uniform distribution of energy and varies from maximum intensity to minimum intensity. At a point of maximum intensity, the energy is 4 times that from a single source whereas at a point of minimum intensity, the energy is zero. However, the average energy is same as if two sources acted separately without interference. Indeed, the energy which apparently disappears at the minimum point is still present at the maximum point. Therefore, the interference phenomenon obeys the law of conservation of energy.

<p><strong>What will happen to the in pattern if the screen is at in the slits?</strong></p>
Ans: We know fringe width in interference is given by, ß = d where. D is the distance between screen and alits and d be the distance between two slits. If the screen is placed at infinity from the slits then D will be infinite. Thus, the fringe width B becomes so large that even a single fringe can occupy the screen. Hence, in this case interference pattern cannot be detected.
