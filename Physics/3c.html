<p><strong>Two organ pipes of same length open at both ends produce sound of different frequencies if their radii are different, why? </strong></p>
Ans: The fundamental frequency in case of open organ pipe is f = 2(1 + 2) = 2(1 + 2 x 0.6 r) = 2(1 + 1.2 r) where c = 0.6 r is end correction. If radii of pipes are different, their frequencies will be different. How do you know the vibration of the fork and the wire are in unison? Ans: When the vibration of the tuning fork and wire are in unison, the wire vibrates with large amplitude. If a small piece of V shaped paper is placed in the middle of the bridges, it will be thrown out violently. It can also be known by hearing beats.

    <p><strong>Why is an end correction necessary for an organ pipe? </strong></p>
Ans. Rayleigh find out that when an air in an can pipe vibrates, the reflection of the sound waves takes place a little above the rim of the organ pipe. Due to this reason, the no length of the air column is greater actual length of the organ pipe.vibrating length of the than the actual length of Therefore, in order to get the for frequency of vibration is necessary to get the accurate value f vibration, the end correction

<p><strong>Note produced by an open or sweeter than that produced in organ pipe. Explain.</strong></p> 
Ans: Because sound produced by op pipe has full set of overtones wh sound produced by the closed organ only odd multiple of fundamental not note produced by an organ pipe than that produced in a closed organ pipe .

<p><strong>How will the fundamental frequeno closed organ pipe be affected if in of air it is filled with a gas heavier air? </strong></p>
Ans: If v be the velocity of sound and l be length of the closed organ pipe. Then th fundamental frequency of this pipe is, f => When air is replaced by a gas heavier than air, then velocity of sound in gas will decrease (i.e. v . 1/VP), where p is the density of the gas. Hence, fundamental frequency will also decrease. 

<p><strong> An open organ pipe is closed at one end,How will the frequency of a fundamental note of the pipe change?</strong></p>
Ans: If y be the velocity of the sound and l be the length of the organ pipe, then the fundamental frequency of an open organ pipe is
f=2l ... (i)
where v is the velocity of sound. When the one end of it is closed, the fundamental frequency of closed organ pipe of same length l is
f' =^1 ... (ii) 
Dividing (ii) by (i), we get
f' V 2l I = 4l T
i.e. f ' = 2l therefore, the fundamental frequency shall reduce to half the orig value.

<p><strong>When we start filling an empty with water, the pitch of sound pr goes on changing. Why?</strong></p> 
Ans: A bucket can be treated as a pu at one end. The frequency of produced = v/41, where v is velocity in air and l is length of air column, equal to depth of water level from end. As the bucket is filled with decreases. Therefore, frequency produced goes on increasing.

<p><strong> A guitarist turns his guitar by turning the tightening screws provided at the end Explain how?</strong></p> 
Ans: The strings of a guitar are the stretched strings whose frequency of the nth mode of an Thore vibration is given as fn = 1, where l is the length of the string and T is the tension applied in it. For a guitar l and u are constant. So to vary frequency the players has to vary tension T. To vary the tension, each string of the guitar is attached to the turning screw which can be rotated clockwise and anticlockwise. Hence in order to tune the guitar to desired frequency (pitch) the guitarist turns on and off the tightening
screws provided on this guitar. 

<p><strong>An open organ pipe and a closed organ pipe have the same length and the same diameter. Do they produce the same quality of sound? Explain.</strong></p> 
Ans: No. The quality of a sound is independent of the dimensions of the vibrating body and depends upon the number of harmonics (or overtones) present in it. In the open pipe, all harmonics are present. In the vibration of the air column in a closed pipe, only odd harmonics are present. In other words, the even harmonics (or the odd overtones) are missing in the closed pipe. Since they do not have the same number of harmonics, the quality of sound produced by open pipe differs from that produced by the closed pipe. Hence, sound produced by the open pipe has better quality than the sound produced by the closed pipe. 

<p><strong>How does the frequency of a turning fork change, when the temperature increased?</strong></p>
Ans: The frequency of tuning fork depends on the length of prongs. As the temperature increases, the length of the prongs increases. This increases the wavelength of the waves in the tuning fork. As frequency, f « 1/2, so frequency of the tuning fork decreases.Tension in a given stretched by four times

<p><strong>Is the wave speed the same as the speed of any part of the string for transv waves? Explain </strong></p>
 Ans: There are two types of speed in the string i.e. wave speed and particle velocity. Wave speed is same in all part of string but the particle velocity varies from zero to some maximum value i.e, zero at node and maximum at anti-node. Hence, wave speed is not same as the speed of any part of the string
for transverse waves. 

<p><strong>If the mass stretching the sonometer wire is dipped in water, how is the frequency of the wire affected? </strong></p>
Ans: If I is the vibrating length of wire, T is the tension in it and u its mass per unit length, then the fundamental frequency of sonometer wire is, f = a Vi When the stretching mass is dipped in water, tension in the wire decreases and hence frequency of the wire also decreases because fx VT.

<p><strong>Is velocity of sound more in hydrogen or nitrogen?</strong></p>
Ans: Velocity of sound in a gas is v = Vö From this relation it is clean that at the same pressure, velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. But density of hydrogen is less than density of nitrogen. ) Hence, sound travels faster in
hydrogen than in nitrogen.
