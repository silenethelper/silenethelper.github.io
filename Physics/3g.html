<p><strong>Light waves undergo diffraction around an edge. Can sound wave different around an edge? Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: The wavelength of light is very small as compared to the wavelength of sound. For the diffraction phenomenon, the size of the edge should be comparable with the wavelength of the wave. So if light wave undergo diffraction around the edge, the sound wave cannot diffract around that edge due to the longer wavelength.
    
<p><strong>Why is the diffraction of sound waves evident in daily experience than that of light waves?</strong></p> 
Ans: To take place diffraction the size of the batacle should be of the order of the Javelength of the waves. We know that the wavelength of light is very small as compared to the size of the obstacle around us so light cannot be diffracted. As the wavelength of light is of the order of such objects, it gets diffracted easily. Due to this reason diffraction of sound waves more evident in
daily experience than that of light waves. 

<p><strong>What is the difference between Fresnel's and Fraunhofer's diffractions?</strong></p>
Ans: When either the source or the screen is near the aperture or obstacle, the wavefronts are spherical and the pattern is quite complex. This is called the Fresnel diffraction.When both the source and screen are placed at a greater distance from the aperture or obstacle, the incident light is plane waves and the rays leaving the opening are parallel. This
is called the Fraunhofer diffraction. 

<p><strong>Radio waves diffract around building but light waves do not. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The reason is that the wavelength of radio waves and sound waves is large and comparable with the size of the obstacles around which they bend. On the other hand, the wavelength of light waves is very small as compared to the size of the obstacles around which they bend and hence diffraction of light
waves cannot be observed easily. 

<p><strong>What are the differences between grating spectra and prismatic spectra?</strong></p> 
Ans. The difference between grating spectra and prismatic spectra are as follows:
The spectra formed by a prism is much more intense than the spectra produced by a grating.  Grating forms a number of spectra on both sides of central image where as a prism forms only one spectra. c. The order of the colour is reverse of that in the prisms of the colour in grating spectrum is reverse spectrum
