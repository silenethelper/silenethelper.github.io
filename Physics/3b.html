    <p><strong>In which medium do the sound waves travel faster, solids, liquids or gases Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The velocity of sound in medium is related by, v = 1 where, E is the modulus of elasticity and p is the density of the medium. The ratio of solid is more greater than the respective two media.
i.e
solid greater than liquid greater than gas 
Hence, the sound wave travels faster in solid than in liquid and least in gas. 

<p><strong>Is velocity of sound more in hydrogen or nitrogen?</strong></p>
Ans: Velocity of sound in a gas is v = VÃ¶ From this relation it is clean that at the same pressure, velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the gas. But density of hydrogen is less than density of nitrogen. Hence, sound travels faster in hydrogen than in nitrogen. 

<p><strong>Air gets thinner as we go up in the atmosphere. Will the velocity of sound change?</strong></p>
Ans: Now, the velocity of sound in air medium is given by, v= root under YP
As we go up, the pressure and density of air both decrease. The ratio of pressure and density remains constant. Hence the velocity of sound will not change if temperature of air remains constant.

<p><strong>Why are sounds heard better on a wet day than on a dry day? </strong></p>
Ans: In the wet day, the atmospheric air becomes moistured than on a dry air. Pressure of moisture in air reduces its density. We know that the velocity of sound in air is inversely proportional to the square root of the density, i.e. v. . Therefore, decrease in density causes the velocity of sound to increase. Hence sounds heard better on a wet day than on a dry day. 

<p><strong>Although the density of solid is high the velocity of sound is great in solid, explain.</strong></p>
Ans: Sound wave is a longitudinal wave.velocity of longitudinal wave is, v = where E is the modulus of elasticity and p is the density of the medium. Since the velocity of sound wave depends upon the ratio E/p of the medium, the ratio E/p is much greater than that for liquid and gas. Hence even if the density of solid is high, the velocity of sound is great in solid. 

<p><strong>Does the sound of an explosion travel faster than the sound produced by a humming bee?</strong></p> 
Ans: Both the sound of the explosion and the sound produced by a humming bee travel with the same speed. However, if the amplitude of the sound of the explosion is so large that the compressions and rarefactions result in appreciable change in temperature, then the speed of the sound of explosion will be greater
than that produced by the humming bee. 

<p><strong>The sound of a distant coming train can be easily detected by placing our ear near the rails. Why?</strong></p>
Ans. The speed of sound is quite large in solids as compared to that in gases. Further, due to high elasticity of solids, the sound waves do not die out soon as happens when sound travels in air. For these reasons, the sound of a distant coming train can be easily detected by placing ear near the rails. 

<p><strong>The speed of sound in humid air is more than in dry air, why? Will the speed of sound in humid hydrogen be more than that in dry hydrogen? </strong></p>
Ans: The density of air decreases with increase of humidity in it. Therefore, speed of sound in humid air is greater than that in the dry air as the velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the air. But the density of hydrogen gas increases with increase of humidity, so the speed of sound in humid hydrogen would be less than that in dry hydrogen. 

<p><strong>What is the velocity of sound in solids, liquids and gases? </strong></p>
Ans: Since the modulus of elasticity of solids is greater than liquids and that of liquids is greater than gases, so the velocity of sound is greater in solids than in liquids and gases.

<p><strong>One end of a long metal pipe is struck a blow. Why does the listener at the other and of the pipe hear two sounds? Explain.</strong></p> What is the time interval between the two sounds
Ans: The listener hears two sounds, one through the pipe and the other through the air. Since the speed of sound is more in metal than that in air, the sound through the pipe reaches listener earlier than that through the air. If vi and v2 are the speed of sound in air and in metal respectively, then the time interval is given by
time interval = t of air - t2of steel  , where l is length of the pipe.

<p><strong>When sound waves travel through medium, does the temperature at various points remain constant? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: According to Laplace's correction for the velocity of sound, the process of compression and rarefaction occur so fast that neither heat is transferred nor it is taken from the surrounding means sound waves propagate through an adiabatic process. But, the temperature in the different regions does not remain same. However, heat is evolved in the compressions and absorbed in the rarefactions, and sound waves propagate through an adiabatic process.
