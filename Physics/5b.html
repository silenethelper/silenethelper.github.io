<p><strong>Lights from a bulbs falls on th table but no photoelectrons bulbs falls on the wooden photoelectrons are emitted.Why? </strong></p>
Ans: A substance emits photoelectrons when energy of the incident photon is greater
work function of the substance. To
photoelectrons from a substance, the oy of the incident light should be more The work function of the substance. Since emit photoelectron energy of the in than the work fun the energy of the light from the bulb
the work function of the wood, so no whoto electrons are emitted from a wooden table. 

<p><strong>Why are alkali metals most suited for photoelectric emission? </strong></p>
Ans. Since the atom of alkali metal has only one valence electron, it is lightly bound with the nucleus so that the work function of alkali metal is less than that of the other metaly So the photoelectrons are easily emitted from the surface of alkali metal with visible light. On the other hand, metals such as zinc, cadmium etc. required high energy radiation (UV light) to emit .

<p><strong>Which has more energy, a photon in the infrared or one in the ultraviolet? Give reasons.</strong></p>
Ans: Energy of photon is given by E = hf = h, where h is Planck's constant and c is velocity of light and 1 is wave length of radiation. It gives E « . It means energy of photon is inversely proportional to its wave length. Again we know wavelength of infrared photon is greater than wavelength of ultra violet photon. Hence from above relation, energy of ultraviolet photon is more than infrared photon. 

<p><strong>Explain why photoelectric effect cannot be observed with all wavelengths of light. </strong></p>
Ans: The wavelength corresponding to threshold frequency is known as threshold wavelength 20. Obviously, 20 = F. The incident radiation with threshold wavelength ro is just capable of ejecting photoelectrons. If the wavelength is more than 10, no photoelectrons are emitted. Thus if the wavelength is shorter than 20, the photoelectrons will be emitted with some kinetic energy. Hence photoelectric effect cannot be observed with all wavelengths of light. 

<p><strong>What is meant by stopping potential?</strong></p>
Ans: The minimum retarding potential at which photoelectric current becomes zero is called stopping potential denoted by Vo. This potential Vo stops the photoelectrons with maximum kinetic energy from reaching the anode and hence name stopping potential. If m is mass of emitted photoelectron and Vmax. is its maximum velocity, then K.Emax. = e Vo = 5 m vềmax. 

<p><strong>If the intensity of light falling on the emissive surface of a photoelectric cell be increased then what will be the effect on (i) current flowing from the cell, (ii) potential difference required to stop the current completely </strong></p>
Ans: (i) On increasing the intensity of the incident light, the number of photoelectrons emitted per second and hence the photoelectric current will increase. (ii) Since. the stopping potential is independent of the intensity of the incident light but depends the frequency of the incident light, hence the
stopping potential will remain unchanged.

<p><strong>Define photoelectric work function ? Is it related to threshold frequency ?</strong></p>
Ans: The minimum amount of radiant needed to pull an electron (without im it any kinetic energy) from a metallic is called work function of the me relation between work function .
threshold frequency fo is E = h fo. 

<p><strong>Why do all the photoelectrons not come out with the same energy if the incident radiation is monochromatic? OR, Why is there an energy distribution of photo-electron? </strong></p>
Ans: The electrons in an atom revolve around the nucleus in different orbits. So the different electrons have different levels of energies. These electrons require different amount of energies to come out of the metal surface. Hence, photo electrons have different wergies. The electrons in the outermost orbit require less energy to come out of the metal surface and hence have larger kinetic energy. 2200, the electrons in the innern
surface .
