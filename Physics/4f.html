<p><strong>Why are the radio frequency chokes air cored? </strong></p>
Ans: The reactance of choke coil is given by XOL = L. 2. f For radio frequency, i.e. for high frequency, L of the coil must be small, otherwise Xit will become very large and the choke will block nearly the whole current. To keeps inductance L low, no magnetic materials should be introduced as the core of the choke. Without any material core, the choke is air cored.

<p><strong>A bulb and a capacitor are connected in series to a source of alternating e.m.f., what will happens if the frequency of the source is increased? </strong></p>
Ans: In this case, we have, Z = VR2 + Xc2 If frequency (f) is increased, the capacitive reactance, Xc = I will decrease. This in turn causes the impedance of the circuit to decrease. Consequently, current in the circuit increases andthe bulb glows more brightly. 

<p><strong> What are the minimum and maximum values of power factor in an a.c. circuit, when do they occur?</strong></p>
Ans: Power factor, cos 0 = ž= Toy, Y2 (i) The minimum value of cos 0 is zero. It will occur when R = 0 and Xų is not equal to Xc. (ii) The maximum value of cos 0 is 1. It will occur when XL = Xc and R is not zero. A bulb in series with air-cored solenoid is connected to a.c. mains. 

<p><strong>If a soft iron core is placed inside the solenoid, the bulb is dimmed, why? </strong></p>
Ans: The impedance of the VR^2 + XL^2 w solenoid, its increases the indue the solenoid and hence circuit also incre current decreases impedance of the circuit is Z = X12. when iron core is placed inside the vid. its inductance (L) increases. This inceases the inductive reactance XL (= 216 fL) of solenoid and hence the impedance of the it also increases, consequently circuit current decreases and the bulb is dimmed. 

<p><strong>Give the physical explanation for the phase difference between voltage and
current in an inductive or capacitive circuit?</strong></p>
Ans: Inductance opposes the change in current and serves to delay the decrease or increase of current in the circuit. This causes the circuit current to lag behind the applied voltage in an inductive circuit. Capacitance opposes the change in voltage and serves to delay the increase or decrease of voltage across the capacitor. This causes the voltage to lag behind the current in a capacitive circuit.

<p><strong>As power factor of an a.c. circuit increases, what is the effect on (i) active power (ii) reactive power? </strong></p>
Ans: Active power, P = Ev Iv cos and reactive power, Q = Ev Iv sin 0 As cos o increases, sin o decreases. So as the power factor increases, the active power increases and reactive power decreases.

<p><strong>Power is dissipated in a.c. circuit having tor only and not in a.c. circuit inductor or capacitor.</strong></p>
 Comment. Ans .The power dissipated in a.c. circuit is given having inductor
by, P = Ev Iv cos e where 0 is phase difference between current and age, when there is resistance only, then
difference is 0°. So P = Ev Iv cos 0o = Ev Iv =
voltage, when phase difference virtual power. When there is then 0 = 90°, so
Here is inductor only or capacitor only, 90°, so power dissipated, P = Ev Iv cos
90° = 0.
z== VR + (XL-Xc)^2

<p><strong>For very high frequency a.c. supply, a capacitor behaves like a pure conductor. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: We know that, Xc =fc. It impidence
Hence at very high frequency, capacitive reactance becomes negligibly small and capacitor
behaves like a pure conductor. 

<p><strong>Why a choke coil cannot be used in d.c.?</strong></p>
Ans: The reactance of a choke coil is given by: XL = 21 fL For d.c., f = 0, so XL = 0. Therefore a choke coil does not oppose current in a d.c. circuit. Hence it cannot be used to control
d.c. 

<p><strong>Prove that the high frequency a.c. can pass through a pure capacitor easily but not through a pure inductor. </strong></p>
Ans: We know inductive reactance, XL = 21 fL i.e., XL « f1 Capacitive reactance, Xc = fc i.e., XC « From these relations, for a high frequency a.c., Xc is small and XL is large. Due to this reason, high frequency a.c. can pass through a purecapacitor easily but not through a pure inductor. 

<p><strong>A capacitor blocks d.c. and allows a.c. to flow  through it. Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: We know that the reactance of a capacitor is X S Xc = 27 fC i.e., Xc « Ē Frequency of d.c., f = 0 therefore, Xc = . Due to this reason, a capacitor does not allow d.c. to flow through it i.e., a capacitor blocks d.c. For a.c., frequency f has a finite value and value of Xc is comparatively smaller. Thus a capacitor allows a.c. to flow through it. The conduction of a.c. is due to continuous charging and
discharging of the capacitor. 

<p><strong>Hot wire instruments are suitable for both a.c. and d.c. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: They are based on heating effect which is independent of direction of current. Hence, it shows deflection for both ac and dc. Due to this reason hot wire instruments are suitable for both
a.c. and d.c.. 

<p><strong>Long distance electric power,transmission line always operates at very high voltage, some time as much to  750 kV. What are the advantages of such high voltages? </strong></p>
Ans: The resistance of the wires that we use for transmission becomes significant and dissipates some energy in the form of heat as given by equation (P = 2R). In addition to this, there is gradual fall of potential along the wire so that the potential available at the target place will be less than that in the station (Vout = Vin -IR). So, the power loss will be minimum when long distance electric power, transmission lines are
operated at very high voltage and low current. 

<p><strong> At high frequencies, a capacitor becomes a short circuit and an inductor an open circuit. Explain?</strong></p> 
Ans: If f is the frequency of a.c. supply, then capacitive and inductive reactance for an a.c. is given by
Xc = 20 fc and X1 = 26 fL For very high frequency i.e. f~, the reactance due to capacitance approaches zero and the reactance due to the inductance becomes very high. Due to this reason, a capacitor behaves as a short circuit and an inductor behaves as an open circuit.

<p><strong>Choke coil is preferred to a resistor in an alternating current circuit. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: In order to regulate current in the circuit we use choke coil in place of resistance. If we do so no electrical energy is wasted. This is because voltage leads the current by an angle /2 and the average power consumed in coil is Pav = Vrms Irms COST/2 = 0. Due to this reason, choke coil is
preferable to a resistor in an a.c. circuit. 

<p><strong>Define power factor and wattless current. </strong></p>
Ans: Ratio of true power and apparent power (virtual power) in an a.c. circuit is called power factor of the circuit, i.e. power factor, cos O = Р Р
= D. Power factor (cos O) is always positive and not more than 1. A current is said to be wattless when it doesn't consume any power when passed through a
rcuit. In case of AC circuit, the power consumed is given by Pay = Ey ly coso, where E, I. is apparent power and cose is power facto When alternating current passes through an inductance
stance emf leads the current by phase angle Tt/2.
So,
P = E, I, cos 90o = 0. Hence curre through an inductance or choke coil is watt
Hence current passes

<p><strong> A 220 V a.c. is more dangerous the such d.c. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: The peak value of 220 V a.c. is V. se for V2 = 311 V. pates n by 
So that, 311 V will cause more harm to ere is than 220 V d.c. Hence, 220 V a that dangerous than 220 V d.c. 

<p><strong> Fluorescent lights often use an inductor. So,to limit the current through the long Why is it better to use an inductor s are than a resistor for this purpose?</strong></p> 
Ans: The resistor consumes power in the for mes heat when we use a resistor to limit the current penetrate the fluorescent light. But, if we use an inductur the inductor consumes no power. Hence, use of then
an inductor is better than a resistor for this .c. is purpose. 

<p><strong>Define r.m.s. value of alternating current.?</strong></p>
Ans: It is that steady current which when inductance passed through a resistance for a given time the produces the same amount of heat as the very alternating current does in the same resistance es as in the same time. 

<p><strong> An ordinary moving coil ammeter us for. d.c. cannot be used to measure alternating current even if its frequency is low. Explain why? </strong></p>
Ans: The average value of current is meas by an ordinary moving coil ammeter average value of alternating current over cycle, even when its frequency is low is zer to this reason the moving coil ammeter d.c. cannot be used to measure an all current even if its frequency is low. 

<p><strong> What do you mean by skin effect.</strong></p>
Ans: When an alternating current through the wire the current is not distributed uniformly over the entire cross-section but when ad.c. current passes through a wire the current is uniformly distributed over the entire crosssection of the wire. The concentration of current is more on outer surface than in inner surface. The distribution of current depends upon frequency. All the current is concentrated on outer surface of the wire for high frequency. This effect is called skin effect.

<p><strong> What are the advantages of a.c. over d.c.?</strong></p>
Ans: The advantage of a.c. over d.c. are:
(i) Generation of a.c. is cheaper than
    generation of d.c. 
(ii) AC can be transmitted to long distances
    without significant loss of power using
    transformers. 
(iii) AC can be converted into de very easily. 
(iv) AC current can be controlled with the help
     of chokes. 
(v) The a.c. voltage can be stepped up and stepped down.
