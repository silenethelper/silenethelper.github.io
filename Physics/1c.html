<p><strong> A helium filled balloon rises to a certain height and then halts. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: Since the density of helium gas is lower than that of air at the ground. The weight of the balloon will be smaller than the upthrust and the balloon rises to a certain height where upthrust is equal to its weight where the density of air and helium is same. 

<p><strong>A sharp knife cuts more easily then a blunt one. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: Sharp knife has a smaller area than a blunt knife. When the same force is applied on the knife, the pressure exerted by the edge of the sharp knife is more than that exerted by the blunt knife during cutting (as pressure = force / area). So, the sharp knife cuts more easily than a blunt one. 

<p><strong>Why do deep sea-divers need special protective diving suits? </strong></p>
Ans: When a sea-divers goes deep in to the sea, the pressure of water on his body increases since the liquid pressure P = h pg. Due to this reason, deep sea divers wear special protective diving suits to overcome the excessive pressure at the greater depth. 

<p><strong> If a cork is released from the bottom of a jar filled with water, what will happen and why? </strong></p>
Ans: If a cork be released from the bottom of a jar filled with water, the cork will rise up and float on the water surface. It is due to the fact that density of cork is less than density of water and upthrust will be greater than its own weight and the upthrust force it to rise.. A wooden ball of density o is immersed in water of density p to a depth h and released. Find the height H (above the surface of water) up to which the ball will jump out of water? Ans: Net upward force, ma = up thrust – weight o V a = p Vg-oVg

<p><strong>An ice cube floats in water. Will the water level rise if the ice melts completely? Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: The water level remains the same. Let V' be the volume of ice cube inside water and V, the whole volume of ice. For floating body. weight of ice = upthrust mi x g = V' * Ow.g or V x pi = V' Ow
or V' =V x Pi
"Ow When whole ice melts, volume of water
mass of water obtained = density by water
mass of ice V x pi 5 density of water - Ow Since the volume of water obtained from melted ice is equal to the volume of ice inside
water level, so water level remains the same. 


<p><strong>It is easier to swim in sea water than in
fresh water. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: Sea water is salty and its density is higher than that of fresh water. Thus, the upthrust experience in sea water is greater than the fresh water. Therefore, a small
portion of our body will be submerged in sea - water, while a large portion of our body is
submerged in fresh water. Hence it is easier
to swim in sea water than in fresh water.

<p><strong>Why does a steel needle sink in water
but not the ship made from the same metal? </strong></p>
Ans: A steel needle has greater density than that of water and it displaces water whose weight is smaller than its weight. A ship is specially design from the steel such that displaced water has more weight than that of
ship. So, the ship floats in water.

<p><strong>Why water does not flow out of a
dropper unless the rubber bulb is pressed? </strong></p>
Ans: The upward air pressure at the tip of the dropper is equal to the pressure of the liquid column in the dropper. This does not allow the water to flow out. When the rubber bulb is pressed, the pressure inside the dropper increases which allows the water to flow out of the dropper.

<p><strong>A body floats in a liquid contained in a
beaker. The whole system falls freely under gravity. What is upthrust on the body due to liquid?</strong></p>
Ans: A body floats on a liquid only when weight of the body is equal to upthrust on it. But when the whole system falls under gravity, a = g and we have weight of the body - upthrust = ma)
or mg - upthrust = ma or mg - ma = upthrust or mg - mg = upthrust
.: upthrust = 0 Hence upthrust on the body falling freely
under gravity is zero. 

<p><strong>If a fish makes itself denser, it will sink;
if it makes itself less dense, it will rise. In terms of buoyant force, why is this so? </strong></p>
Ans: When the fish increases its density by decreasing its volume, it displaces less water, so the buoyant force decreases. When the fish decreases its density by expanding, it displaces a greater volume of water, and the
buoyant force increases. 

<p><strong> What do you mean by buoyancy?</strong></p>
Ans: A body immersed in a liquid displaces a volume of liquid equal to the immersed portion of the body. The displaced liquid exerts an upward force on the body due to pressure difference at the bottom and top levels. This force is called the upthrust or buoyancy.

<p><strong>Why is the reading of a mercury
barometer always less than actual pressure? </strong></p>
Ans: Due to property of surface tension, mercury in the tube gets depressed. Consequently, the observed height of mercury in the barometer tube is less than its actual height. Thus, the reading of mercury barometer is always less than the
actual pressure. 

<p><strong> Why the passengers are advised to remove the ink from their pen while going up an aeroplane?</strong></p>
Ans: We know that atmospheric decreases with height. Since ink : pen is filled at the atmospheric existing on the surface of earth. come out to equalize the pressure spoil the clothes of the passengers. are advised to remove the ink from the
that atmospheric pressure icht. Since ink inside the
he atmospheric pressure surface of earth, it tends to come out to equalize the pressure. This can passengers, so they are advised to remove the ink from the pen 

<p><strong> The purity of gold can be tested
weighing it in air and in water. How? </strong></p>
Ans: If wi and w2 are the weights of gold, air and water respectively, then
W1
Specific gravity of the gold = winwa If the calculated specific gravity of gold is in agreement with that of standard gold, it i
pure gold. Otherwise it is not pure.

<p><strong>In hot air ballooning, a large balloon is
filled with air heated by a gas burner at the bottom. Why must the air be heated? </strong></p>
Ans: In hot air ballooning, a large balloon is filled with air heated by a gas burner at the bottom. This rises the air temperature of air inside the balloon which makes it lighter than the 
surrounding air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it.
The amount of lift (buoyancy) provided to a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the balloon and the temperature of air
outside it. 1

<p><strong> Why do clouds seem to be floating in the
sky?</strong></p>
 Ans: Clouds are tiny particles of water. The upthrust force acting on the clouds and viscous force on it balance weight. As a result, the cloud particles gain terminal velocity and move with a constant speed in the sky. So, they seem to be floating in the
sky. 

<p><strong> Which one gives the feeling of heaviness in the case of a kilogram of cotton or å kilogram of lead? Why?</strong></p>
Ans: A kilogram of lead gives the feeling ! heaviness than a kilogram of cotton, since the density of lead is greater than density
cotton. The one ki more space than 1
The one kilogram of cotton occupies
ace than lead of same mass i.e. Jume of one kilogram of cotton is more than
lead.

<p><strong> Why the a small piece of camphor dance about on the water surface?</strong></p>
Due to its irregular shape, the camphor dissolves more rapidly at some points others. When it dissolves, the surface
of water is reduced. As the force of e tension reduces by different amounts different points of the camphor piece, a
ultant force acts on it which makes it dance about on water surface. 

<p><strong>Why the small liquid drops are spherical while large drops are flat or oval?</strong></p>
ans There are two types of forces acting on a liquid drop i.e. surface tension and force of oravity. Due to surface tension, the liquid tends to occupy minimum surface area and Thence tends to get spherical shape but due to force of gravity, the liquid tends to occupy the Towest centre of gravity and hence tends to become flat. In small drops, the force of surface tension is much greater than the force of gravity so small liquid drops are spherical. (In large drops, the force of gravity is much greater than the surface tension force. Hence the
large liquid drops are flat.

<p><strong> A small needle keeps floating when
placed gently on the surface of water, but sinks when a small detergent is dissolved in water. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: The force acting on the needle are surface tension and force of gravity i.e. weight. The net force of surface tension is acting vertically upward and balances weight of the needle. But if a small detergent is dissolved in water, the surface tension of water decreases and the upward surface tension force is insufficient to balance the
weight of needle. Hence the needle sinks.

<p><strong> Why does the free surface of a liquid behave like an elastic stretched membrane? </strong></p>
Ans: The liquid molecules on the surface experience a downward force. So they have greater potential energy. In order to have minimum energy, the free surface tends to contract to minimum area and hence behaves
an elastic stretched membrane.

<p><strong>Hot soup is tastier than cold soup. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The taste of soup is based on how well soup spreads over the taste buds of the tongue. Increase of temperature reduces the surface tension. Since hot soup has less surface tension than cold soup so that hot soup spreads through out in our tongue and
we feel tasty. 

<p><strong> How does the shape of the surface of mercury look like in a capillary tube dipped in it? </strong></p>
Ans: When a capillary tube dipped in liquid of mercury, the liquid is depressed in the tube below the level of mercury in the vessel. The shape of liquid mercury inside the tube is convex meniscus. This is because the cohesive force between mercury molecules is greater than the adhesive force between mercury molecule and the molecules of the tube. As a result the angle of constant becomes greater than 90° and the liquid depressed and takes convex meniscus inside
the tube. 

<p><strong> It is observed that the surface of a liquid in a capillary tube dipped in it is either convex or concave. What may be the reason? Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: It is observed that the surface of a liquid in a capillary tube dipped in it is either convex or concave. The reason behind this is cohesive force of liquid molecules and adhesive force between liquid molecule and molecules of tube. If the adhesive force between liquid and solid molecules is more, then the surface of liquid is concave and if cohesive force between liquid molecules is
more, the surface is convex.

<p><strong> Mercury does not spread over a sheet of glass while water does. Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: In the case of mercury-glass, the adhesive force is less than cohesive force between mercury molecules. Hence mercury does not spread over a sheet of glass. On the other hand, the adhesive force between water-glass molecules is more than cohesive force between water molecules and hence
water spreads over glass.

<p><strong> A drop of oil placed on the surface of water spreads out but a drop of water placed on oil contracts. Why?</strong></p>
 Ans: The cohesive forces between the oil molecules are less than the adhesive forces between water mole hur molecules and oil molecules.
Therefore the drop of oil placed on water surface spreads out. On the other hand, the cohesive forces between water molecules are greater than the adhesive forces between water molecules and oil molecules. So the drop of water placed on oil surface contracts.

<p><strong> Why is soap solution a better cleaning agent than ordinary water? </strong></p>
Ans: A cloth has narrow spaces in the form of fine capillaries. 2T cos e The capillary rise is given by h = rpg Adding of soap to water reduces the angle of contact e. It will increase the value of cos e and hence h. It means that soap water will rise more in the narrow spaces in the cloth and clean fabrics better than water can do alone.

<p><strong> Two drops of mercury when brought together coalesce into one. Why?</strong></p>
 Ans: When two drops of mercury is brought together, they coalesce into one because the surface energy of the large drop is less than the total surface energy of the two small drops. Therefore, to attain a state of minimum energy, the drops of mercury coalesce into one when brought near each other. Less is the energy more is the stability.

<p><strong> What happens when a capillary tube of insufficient length is dipped in a liquid?</strong></p>
 Ans: When a capillary tube of insufficient noth is dipped in a liquid, the liquid rises to the top. The radius of curvature of the meniscus increases till the presance concave side becomes equal to the exerted by the liquid column of in length. But the liquid does not overflow .

<p><strong> In still air, a helium filled balloon na up to a certain height and then rising. Why?</strong></p>
A helium filled balloon the weight of air displaced by the ball more than its weight i.e. greater up (U). But U = Vpg where p is density of fluid it is air). The density of air decreases with incre, height. When the helium balloon rises certain height where density consequently upthrust is such that balances the balloon's weight. The balla stops rising further up and it halts.h increasing n rises to a ensity and uch that is the balloon

<p><strong> Define viscosity. Does it depend on temperature? </strong></p>
Ans: The property of a liquid by virtue which it opposes the relative motion between its different layers is known as viscosity. Yes the viscosity of the liquid depends on temperature: it increases with decrease in
temperature.

<p><strong> Machine parts are jammed in cold days.Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The viscosity of a liquid decreases with rise in temperature. Lubricating oil is used in a machine parts to reduce the friction. In cold days, temperature decreases and hence the viscosity of the lubricant increases. So, the machine parts are jammed in winter. 

<p><strong> During certain windstorm, light roofs are blown off. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: During wind storm, the velocity of the wind flowing over the roof becomes higher than that of the wind flowing under it. According to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure outside the roof is less than the pressure below the roof. This difference in pressure results an upward force on the roof
and so the roof is blown off. 

<p><strong> Why dust generally settles down in a closed room?</strong></p>
 Ans: Dust particles are spheres of small radii. After acquiring the terminal velocity, they start falling through air with uniform speed. As the terminal velocity for small dust particles will be very small, they will settle down in a closed room after some time.

<p><strong>Why are the wings of an aeroplane SY. Slightly convex outwards while flattened inwards?</strong></p>
 Ans: The air above the wing has to travel longer path. So, the velocity of the air above the wing is more than that below the wing. According to Bernoulli's theorem, the pressure below the wings is greater than that above it and hence , the aeroplane is lifted upward .

<p><strong>Why a hot liquid moves faster than a cold liquid?</strong></p>
Ans Viscosity of a liquid decreases with increase in temperature. Therefore, viscosity P hot liquid is smaller than that of a cold. liquid and so, hot liquid moves faster than the cold liquid.

<p><strong>Why does velocity of water increase when it enters from a broader pipe to a narrower pipe?</strong></p>
Ans: According to equation of continuity, av = constant, where a is the area of crosssection and v, the velocity of the liquid flow. When water flowing in a broader pipe enters a narrow pipe, the area of cross-section of the water decreases, therefore the velocity of
water increases. 

<p><strong>Why rain drops falling under gravity do not gain very high velocity? </strong></p>
Ans: When the rain drops fall freely under gravity, their motion is opposed by the viscous drag of air. They attain terminal velocity when the viscous force due to air · becomes equal to the weight of the drops and terminal velocity, u « r2 As radii of rain drops are small, so they do
not acquire very high terminal velocity. 

<p><strong> When a smooth-flowing stream of water comes out of a faucet, it narrows as it falls. Explain why this happens.</strong></p>
 Ans: From equation of continuity, av = constant, it is clear that the velocity of flow increases with decrease of cross-section and yice-versa. When the stream of water falls from the faucet, its velocity of flow increases due to gravity and hence its cross-section must decrease. That is why, the stream
narrows as it falls. 

<p><strong> Why is it dangerous to stand near the edge of the platform when a fast train is crossing it? OR Why is a suction effect experienced by a person standing close to the platform at a station when a fast train passes?.</strong></p>
  Ans: When a fast train crosses the platform, the air dragged along with the train also moves with a high velocity. In accordance with Bernoulli's equation, the pressure in the region of high velocity gets decreased If a person stands near the edge of the platform he may be pushed towards the train due to high pressures outside  This effect is called suction effect. In this way a suction effect is experienced by a person standing close to the platform at a station when a fast train passes.

<p><strong> Small air bubbles rise slowly while big bubbles rise rapidly through the liquid. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The terminal velocity of a body through a fluid is given by, v = = 2r2 (p -o) This shows that if the radius increases, the terminal velocity also increases. If the air bubbles are large, they have larger radius, so the terminal velocity will be larger. However, if the radius of the air bubble is small, the terminal velocity will be less. Hence, small air bubbles rise slowly while big bubbles rise
rapidly through the liquid.
