<p><strong>what is  thermoelectric emf?</strong></p>
    The production of two dissimilar metals and production of electricity by keeping the junctions of two dissimilar
    forent temperatures is called hermoelectric effect. The e.m.f. thus produced across the junctions is called thermoelectric em.f. The magnitude and direction of thermoelectric e.m.f. depends on the nature of the materials forming the thermocouple and the temperature difference between the two junctions. 
    
<p><strong> What is the cause of electric current in thermo electricity? </strong></p>
    Ans: The origin of potential difference due to difference of temperature between two parts
the same conductor or between two ctions of a thermocouple is the cause of ctric current in thermo electricity.

<p><strong>What do you mean by thermoelectric series?</strong></p>
Ans: An arrangement of metals in series in which two metals can be used to form a
thermocouple is called thermoelectric series. thermoelectric series is antimony, iron,
lead, copper, platinum, cobalt,etc

<p><strong>What do you mean by Peltier Coefficient? </strong></p>
Ans: Peltier coefficient at any temperature for the junction of two metals is the product of absolute temperature and thermoelectric power at that temperature. Peltier's
coefficient, denoted by n is t = TP. 5

<p><strong>Why do we generally prefer Sb-Bi thermocouple in all experimental work?</strong></p>
Ans: The thermo emf generated is large if the metal forming the thermocouple are far apart, in the thermo 
electric series. That is the case with Sb and Bi because Sb is the first member of the series and Bi is the last member of the series.

<p><strong>What is a thermocouple? </strong></p>
Ans: A couple of wires of dissimilar metals forming a loop and thermoelectricity is called thermocouple. Figure shows an iron-copper thermocouple.
Iron
Hota
Cold
Copper

<p><strong>What do you mean by Seebeck effect?</strong></p>
Ans: If two different metal wires are joined to form a closed circuit and two junctions are kept at different temperatures, a small emf is set up in the circuit and small current flows in the circuit in a definite direction. This effect is
called thermoelectric effect or Seebeck effect.

<p><strong>What do you mean by Peltier effect?</strong></p>
Ans: When an electric current is passed through a thermocouple, heat is either absorbed or released at the junctions, depending on the direction of current flow. This effect is called Peltier effect. This is a reversible effect. That is, when direction of current is reversed, the heat evolved or absorbed is interchanged at the junction. Peltier effect is the inverse process of Seebeck effect

<p><strong>Thermocouple acts as a heat engine.Why? </strong></p>
Ans: It is because like heat engine, in thermocouple heat Q1 from the source is absorbed by the hot junction and heat Q2 is rejected at the cold junction. The difference of heat Q1 - Q2 is converted into electrical energy and hence thermo e.m.f. is produced.

<p><strong> What is neutral temperature? On what factors does it depend? </strong></p>
Ans: The temperature of the hot junction at which the thermo emf becomes maximum is known as neutral temperature (On). The neutral temperature depends on the nature of thermocouple but it is independent
of temperature of junctions. 

<p><strong> Why is Lead (Pb) used as a standard reference metal in thermo-electricity? </strong></p>
Ans: When a thermocouple is formed from a pair of metals in series, the direction of flow of current is through the cold junction which lies earlier in the series to that one occurs later. The thermoelectric series elements are Antimony, Iron, Zinc, Silver, lead, Copper, Cobalt, Nickel, Bismuth, etc. Here, the lead is used as a standard reference metal in thermoelectricity because the thermo emf of lead is almost zero.

<p><strong> Does the thermo-electric effect obey Law of conservation of energy? Explain</strong></p>
Ans: Yes, the production of thermo emf in thermocouple is the result of conversion of the net heat absorbed in the thermocouple into electric energy. Hence, thermoelectric effect
obeys the law of conservation of energy. 

<p><strong>What is neutral temperature ? On what factors does it depend ?</strong></p>
Ans: The temperature of the hot junction at which the thermo emf becomes maximum is known as neutral temperature . The neutral temperature nature of thermocouple but it is independent of temperature of junctions.

<p><strong> Why is Lead (Pb) used as standard reference metal in thermo-electrivity ?</strong></p>
 Ans: When a thermocouple is formed for pair of metals in series, the direction of flow of current is through the cold junction which earlier in the series to that one occurs later The thermoelectric series elements are Antimony, Iron, Zinc, Silver, lead, Copper Cobalt, Nickel, Bismuth, etc. Here, the lead is used as a standard reference metal in thermoelectricity because the thermo emf of lead is almost zero.
