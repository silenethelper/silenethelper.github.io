<p><strong>Why are X-rays diffracted by crystals?</strong></p>
Ans: For the diffraction, the wavelength of the radiation should be comparable to the size of the slit or obstacles. As the atoms of crystals are arranged regularly in the planes of crystals and the distance between these planes is of the order of 1 A, the nearly equal wavelength of X-rays.Therefore, X-rays are diffracted by crystals. 

<p><strong>The X-rays can penetrate through the flesh of meat but not through the bones. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The flesh of meat made up from lighter elements but the bones is made from heavier elements. So that X-rays penetrate through the flesh of meat but not through the bones. Further, the penetrating power of X-rays can be controlled by controlling the voltage between cathode and the target. For a medical purposes, X-rays are produced in such a way that the Xrays penetrate through the flesh but not through the bones. 

<p><strong>Distinguish between X-rays and cathode rays? </strong></p>
Ans: X-rays are electromagnetic waves which travel with the velocity of light in vacuum. They are not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Whereas, cathode rays are streams of electrons whose velocity is less than that of the light. They are deflected by electric and magnetic fields. 28. The total energy of an electron of an atom in an orbit is negative. What does this negative energy indicate? Ans: The total energy of an electron in an orbit is me^4 given by, E = -8 62 n2 h2 where n = 1, 2, 3, ..... The negative sign associated with each energy level indicates that the electron is bounded to the nucleus i.e. the force on the electron is attractive. Moreover, the energy for higher orbit is higher. Hence, energy is to be supplied if it is to be taken from lower orbit to higher orbit.

<p><strong></strong>How is the quality of X-rays controlled? </strong></p>
Ans: Quality of X-rays means the penetrating power of X-rays which is associated with frequency. The frequency of X-rays depends on the applied voltage between the cathode and the anode.
Therefore, the quality of X-rays depends on the frequency of the X-rays which can be controlled by controlling the applied voltage between cathode and anode. 

<p><strong>A patient is suggested to put off gold ornaments before entering into the Xrays room. Explain why? </strong></p>
Ans: Gold is high atomic weight element. So, when X-rays fall upon it, it may emit secondary X-rays. The X-rays thus originated are uncontrolled X-Rays which may damage the tissues in our body. This is why patients are suggested to put off gold ornaments before entering into the X-ray room. 

<p><strong>Why is a patient suggested to drink a solution (Barium sulphate) before taking the X-ray photograph of his internal organs? </strong></p>
Ans: The solution like Barium sulphate solution contains heavy atoms i.e. Barium atoms. These atoms absorb more X-rays than light atoms. When the patient drinks such solution, the solution gets collected more close to the foreign bodies like stone, bullets, formation of stones etc. in his internal organs. When X-rays are passed through the body of the patient, then X-rays are absorbed more near the foreign bodies, thus giving their clear pictures. Due to this reason, a patient is suggested to drink a Barium sulphate solution before taking the X-ray picture of his internal organs.

<p><strong>In the production of X-ray, how will you control the penetrating power of X-rays?</strong></p>
Ans: Penetrating power of X-ray depends on its energy. Energy of X-ray depends on applied potential difference across the target and the filament. So as potential difference is increased, penetrating power of X-ray is also increased and vice versa. Hence penetrating power of X-ray can be controlled by controlling the applied potential difference between the two electrodes in X-ray tube.

<p><strong>Production of X-ray is the reverse phenomenon of photoelectric effect. Justify this statement. </strong></p> 
Ans: When fast moving electrons strike on high atomic weight substance, X-ray is produced and when radiations of sufficient frequency incident on the metal surface, electrons are emitted i.e. photoelectric effect takes place. It means fast moving electrons produce X-ray and X-ray i.e. radiations produce photoelectrons. Hence X-ray is the reverse phenomena of photoelectric effect.

<p><strong>How is the intensity of X-rays controlled in the production of X-rays? </strong></p>
Ans: If the number of electrons striking the target is more, then more number of X-rays are produced. More number of electrons can be produced by heating the cathode of the X-ray tube at higher temperature. By passing more current through the cathode, it can be heated at higher temperature. Therefore, the intensity of X-rays can be controlled by controlling the heating current in the cathode of the X-rays
tube. 

<p><strong>When X-rays are produced only about 10% of the initial input energy appears as X-ray energy. Explain what has happened to the other 90% of the energy?</strong></p>
Ans: When fast moving electrons strike a target of high atomic number like Tungsten, Molybdenum etc. X-rays are produced. The electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated by a potential of many thousand volts to strike against the target. If the electrons moving with high velocity strike the target, about 10% of initial input energy appears as Xray energy and other 90% of the energy is converted into heat. 

<p><strong> If matter has a wave nature, why is the not observable in our daily experience</strong></p>
Ans: The de-Broglie wavelength 2 associated with a particle of mass m moving with velocity v is given by
h = mv.
From this equation it is clear that, the lighter the particle, the greater is its de-Broglie wavelength and the faster the particle moves. the smaller is its de-Broglie wave length. The wave nature of the matter can be apparent if the wavelength of the wave associated with the moving matter is of the size of the matter. In daily life, particles are heavier and they move with comparatively low speed, Hence this is not observable in our daily experiences. For example a marble of mass 66 gram moving with a velocity of 1 ms-i has de-Broglie wavelength
6.6 x 10-34 a = 1 x 10-32 m. Since this 66 x 10-3 wavelength is too small that cannot be detected. Hence, wave nature matter is not apparent if our daily life.
