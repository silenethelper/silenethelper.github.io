<p><strong>What are seismic waves? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: When an earthquake occurs, seismic waves transmit energy from the source i.e. focus. Seismic waves are also called elastic waves because they cause deformation of the material in which they propagate. The deformations consist of alternating compression and dilatations. They are mainly two groups of seismic waves: body waves and surface waves. 

<p><strong>>What are body waves? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: Body waves transmit through the earth's interior. They are also classified into two types: the longitudinal and the transverse. Longitudinal waves are compressional types and can propagate through solid as well as liquid. However, transverse waves transmit only through solids. The compressional wave is analogous to sound wave. It is also called push or primary wave because of its early arrival and is represented by P-wave. When compressional phase of Pwave passes through the station, the ground in its immediate surrounding gets compressed. When rarefactional part of the Pwave reaches the station, the ground gets dilated. The second arrival wave is called shear or S-wave. S-wave is transverse in nature similar to light wave. It travels with 0.6 the speed of P-wave. Shear waves do not pass through the outer core of the earth. 

<p><strong>What are surface waves? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: Similar to the body waves there are two types of surface waves: Love and Rayleigh waves. Love wave is faster and is of transverse type. It has no vertical component. The wavelength of this wave at long epicentral distance is a function of the thickness of the layered structure traversed.
It is used to determine the crustal and mental thicknesses. It has velocity close but slightly less than that of S-wave. In a Rayleigh wave the earth particle follows a retrogate elliptical orbit in a vertical plane through the direction of propagation. The velocity of Rayleigh wave is about 0.92 times that of shear wave. It has no horizontal component. 

<p><strong>>What are main characteristics of the seismic waves? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: The main characteristics of seismic waves are as below: Name Type
Characters P Wave Longitudinal Also known as primary, compressional, or acoustic waves; fastest seismic wave S wave Transverse Also known as secondary, or shear waves; do not travel through fluids Rayleigh Surface Rolls along surface like a Wave water wave; large amplitude Love Surface Ground moves side to Wave
side as wave moves forward, more destructive 

<p><strong>>How does elastic rebound theory describe the earthquake activity in a given region?</strong></p> 
Ans: The elastic rebound theory implies that earthquake activity represents a stepwise response to persistent strain. It is evident that three conditions are required to produce earthquakes: relative motion in the earth, stress generation, and stress release.

<p><strong> What causes gravitational waves?</strong></p>
Ans: The gravitational waves are created when huge cosmic obiects mount earthquake activity represents a stepwise response to persistent strain. It is evident that three conditions are required to produce earthquakes: relative motion in the earth, stress generation, and stress release.

<p><strong>>What causes gravitational waves? </strong></p>
Ans: The gravitational waves are created when huge cosmic objects move at very high speeds. Some examples that could cause a gravitational wave are i) when a star explodes (supernovae) ii) when two big stars orbit each other and, iii) when two black holes orbit each other and merge. But the objects that create gravitational waves are far away from earth.The waves are then very weak by the ti they reach Earth. This makes gravitational waves challenging to detect.

<p><strong>How one can read a seimogram?</strong></p>
Ans: In a seismogram, seismic waves are recorded in form of wavy lines. There are some marks (or dots)representing time for every minute.As P waves are the fastest seismic waves, they will usually the first wiggle (bigger than the rest of the little ones) as shown in the Fig. The next set of seismic waves will be the S waves. These are usually bigger than the P waves. Surface waves have velocity less than S waves so they arrive at the seismograph just after the S waves. The surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves) are often larger, on the seismogram. They have a lower frequency, i.e. waves (the ups-anddowns) are more spread out. For shallow earthquakes, the surface waves may be the largest waves recorded by the seismograph.

<p><strong> What is meant by gravitational waves?</strong></p>
Ans: Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in space-time caused by some of the most viole and energetic processes in the Univers When such gigantic objects move,
curvature of space-time changes and, these changes propagate outwards (similar to ripples on a pond) as gravitational waves. Such a wave is a stretch and squash of space and so can be found by measuring the change in length between two objects. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity. LIGO observed such waves from two black
holes in 2015.

<p><strong>What do you mean by shadow zone for seismic phases?</strong></p>
Ans: A seismic shadow zone is an area of the Earth's surface where seismographs cannot detect an earthquake after its seismic waves have passed through the Earth. A shadow zone exists because the seismic waves are refracted as they pass through the core and the mantle boundary (CMB) and are diverted from their original paths. P waves do travel through liquids, so they can pass through the liquid part of the core. Due to the refraction that takes place at the CMB, waves that travel through the core are bent away from the surface, and this creates a Pwave shadow zone on either side, from 103° to 142°.Similarly, the area of the Earth's surface where S waves are not detected following an earthquakeisthe S wave shadow zone. S-waves do not travel through liquids. The entire zone beyond 103° does not receive S-waves, and hence this zone is identified as the shadow zone of S-waves. These shadow zones has led geologists to a model of the Earth with a solid mantle and a liquid core.

<p><strong> What is nanotechnology? </strong></p>
Ans: Nanotechnology, shortened to 'nanotech', is the study of the control of matter in an atomic and molecular scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with structure of the size 100 nanometer or smaller, and involves developing materials or devices with in that size. Nanotechnology is very diverse, ranging from novel extension of conventional devices physics, to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, to developing new materials with dimensions on the nano scale, even to speculation on whether we can directly control matter to the atomic scale. Nanotechnology has the potential to create many new materials and devices with wide ranging applications. 

<p><strong>What is the Higgs boson in simple terms?</strong></p>
Ans: The Higgs boson is the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that gives mass to other fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks. A particle's mass determines how much it resists changing its speed or position when it encounters a force.
