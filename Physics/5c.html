    <p><strong>Why does the conductivity of the semiconductor increase with the rise of temperature? </strong></p>
Ans: When a semiconductor is heated, more and more electrons jump across the forbidden gap from valence band to conduction band where these are free to conduct electricity, Hence the conductivity increases with the increase in temperature. 

<p><strong>Why does the width of depletion layer of a PN junction increases in reverse biasing? </strong></p>
Ans: During reverse biasing, the positive terminal of the external battery attracts electrons from the n-region and its negative terminal attracts holes from the p-region i.e. the majority charge carriers move away from the junction. This increases the width of the depletion layer. 

<p><strong>What is an ideal junction diode?</strong></p>
Ans: A junction diode which conducts when forward biased and does not conduct when reverse biased is called an ideal junction diode. It offers zero resistance in forward biasing and infinite resistance in reverse
biasing. 

12. Why is zener diode fabricated by heavily doping both p and n side of the junction? </strong></p>
Ans: When zener diode is fabricated by heavily doping both p and n side of the junction the depletion region formed in zener diode is very thin and the electric field across the junction is very high even for a small
reverse bias voltage. 

<p><strong>What is an integrated circuit?</strong></p>
Ans: A miniature electronic circuit, consisting of many passive components like R and C and active components like diode and transistor, fabricated within a single semiconductor chip
is called an integrated circuit. 

<p><strong>Why is a NOT gate known as an inverter?</strong></p>
Ans: In the NOT gate as input is low (0), the output is high (1) and vice versa. So a NOT gate always inverts the input signal. Hence a NOT gate is known as an inverter. 

<p><strong>How is a NOT gate different from AND or
OR gate? Can it be made from junction diodes? </strong></p>
Ans: NOT gate has only one input while AND or OR gates can have two or more inputs. A NOT gate cannot be made from junction . It is realized by using a transistor.

<p><strong>Distinguish between electrons and holes. </strong></p>
Ans: (i) Electron is a negatively charged particle having charge = 1.6 10-19 C. Hole is a seat having positive charge which is produced when an electron breaks away from a covalent bond in a semiconductor. Hole is having the same charge as that of electron. (ii) Energy of a hole is high as compared to that of electron. (iii) The mobility of a hole is smaller than that of electron.

<p><strong>Why is the semiconductor damaged by a strong current? </strong></p>
Ans: When a strong current is passed through a semiconductor, it heats up the semiconductor. Due to which the large number of covalent bonds break up in semiconductor, resulting large number of charge carriers. As a result of which, the material starts behaving as a conductor. At this stage, the semiconductor losses the
roperty of low conduction, hence it is said to be damaged.

<p><strong>The resistance of PN junction is to when forward biased and is high when reversed biased. Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: A small increase in forward voltage across p-n junction shows large increase in forward current. Hence the resistance voltage/current) of p-n junction is low when forward biased. A large increase in reverse voltage across p-n junction shows small increase in reverse current. Hence the resistance of p-n junction is high when reverse biased.

<p><strong>An N-type semi conductor has a large number of electrons. It is electrically neutral? Explain.</strong></p> 
Ans: An N-type semiconductor is formed when neutral pentavalent atoms are doped in a neutral crystal of a semiconductor. As it is the combination of two neutral atoms without loss or gain of any electrons. The N-type semiconductor has excess electrons only in its conduction band. In totality, it has equal number of electrons and protons. So, N-type semiconductor is electrically neutral.

<p><strong>How does the suitable impurity increase conductivity of a semiconductor?</strong></p>
ans An intrinsic semiconductor has very poor ponductivity. To get large current at a given
Itage, the suitable impurity has to be added in the intrinsic semiconductor. If the suitable impurity is added to an intrinsic semiconductor, it causes either an excess of free electrons or an excess of holes. When the number of charge carries increased, the conductivity of the semiconductor increases. 

<p><strong>A P type semiconductor has a large number of holes but still it is electrically neutral. Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: By doping Silicon (or Germanium) crystal with electrically neutral trivalent impurity a P type semiconductor is formed. After doping, the trivalent atom becomes negatively charged accepting an electron from the silicon crystal and an atom of the crystal becomes positively charged or a hole is created in a silicon atom. So if n trivalent atoms are electrons are accepted from the doped, n silicon crystal and n holes are created in the valance band of the crystal. Since the number of the trivalent ions which are negatives is equal to the number of holes in the P type crystal, it remains electrically neutral.

<p><strong>The conduction in a metal is mainly due to electrons, Justify.</strong></p> 
Ans: The valence band and conduction band overlap each other in a metal. Hence, free electrons are available in it. Due to this overlapping, a slight potential difference across the metal can cause the free electrons. O constitute electric current. Therefore, the onduction in a metal is mainly due to the electrons.

<p><strong>A semi-conductor has electrons and holes as charge carriers. Do conductors also have the holes as charge carriers? Justify.</strong></p>
Ans: There is covalent bond in the semiconductors, and at low temperature, all of the covalent bonds are unbroken. Atoms of the conductor need energy of the order of 1 eV to shake off the valance electrons which become available to it, even at room temperature. And due to thermal agitation of the crystal structure, electrons from a few covalent bonds come out. The bond from which electron  is freed, a space is created. This space in the covalent bond is called hole. Hole is equivalent to a positive charge whose magnitude is the same as the that of an electron. No, holes cannot be created in conductors. The conductors, generally are group I, II and III elements. They do not share electrons of other elements.
