<p><strong>In T.V. usually a magnetic field is deflect the electron beam and not electric field. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: If electric field is used then we have to apply a very high voltage, or we may require a very long tube. However, if a magnetic field is used, even a small field can produce large deflection. On the other hand, the required size of the picture tube will be highly reduced. Due to this reason, the magnetic field is used to deflect the electron bean  in T.V. instead of the electric field.

<p><strong>Discuss the physical determination involved Millikan's experiment for the mination of the charge of an electron. </strong></p>
Ans: The principle of Millikan's experiment is sure the terminal velocity of the charged oil blets (i) under the action of gravity alone and (ii) nder the combined action of gravity and electric field opposed to 
gravity. Knowing the terminal velocities under these conditions, we can easily find the charge on each droplet. It will be found that every charged droplet has a charge equal to integral multiple of basic charge e (i.e. 2e, 3e, 4e, etc.) 

<p><strong>Why a glowing gas, such as that in a neon tube, gives only certain wavelengths of light?</strong></p>
Ans: Neon tube is a discharge tube containing neon at low pressure. Due to potential difference maintained between the cathode and the anode, electrons are accelerated towards the anode and in colliding with neon atoms ionize them and excite the positive ions. When these decay to a lower energy level, they emit the characteristic Pink light. Hence a glowing gas such as that in a neon tube, gives only certain wavelength of light.

<p><strong>Cathode rays can not be regarded as lectromagnetic waves. Why ?</strong></p>
Ans: Cathode rays charged particles and magnetic are streams of negatively ged particles which are deflected by electric magnetic fields but electromagnetic waves. chargeless which are not deflected magnetic fields. Hence cathode rays are not deflected by magnetic and electromagnetic waves.

<p><strong>Did Millikan's experiment lead to quantum nature of the electric charge?</strong></p>
Ans In Millikan's experiment, it was found that the charge carried by oil drop is an integral multiple of charge of an electron, therefore, the charge on the oil drop is, Q = n e, where e is the charge on an electron and n is an integer. This gives the quantum nature of electric charge. 

<p><strong> What is the use of X-rays in Millikan's oil drop experiment? </strong></p>
Ans: When the oil drop coming out of the nozzle of the atomizer, it gets charged with air. But, sometimes, the oil drops sprayed in to the space between the two metal plates do not get enough charge. In such a case, as the X-ray is passed through them, the oil drops moving between the plates can be fully charged.

<p><strong>why is clock oil used in Millikan's experiment? Can we use water in place of the clock oil?</strong></p>
Ans: In Millikan's oil drops experiment, the size of the droplet should be small and should not evaporate. Due to the small droplet, it acquires small terminal velocity. In water we do not find such types of condition because water may evaporate due to its high vapour pressure and the droplets of water are quite large. The above requirement will be fulfilled in the case of clock
oil and hence it is used in Millikan's experiment. 

<p><strong> Is the Stoke's relation F = 6 nrv applicable to very minute size oil drops? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: No, it is not strictly applicable to very small drops since Stoke's formula is valid for motion through a homogeneous medium. For this the radius of drop should be much larger than the intermolecular separation. To an extremely small drop, molecules of the medium will appear as points of concentration of mass, i.e., discrete points. 

<p><strong>Why does electric discharge take place at low pressure and high potential difference? </strong></p>
Ans: At low pressure and high potential, ionized particles can move towards electrodes which acquire sufficient kinetic energy and in their way can ionize other gas atoms. More ions and electrons are produced in the gas due to collisions. The electrons move towards the anode and the positive ions move towards the cathode. Hence electric discharge takes place at low pressure and high potential through the gas.

<p><strong>What is the importance of Millikan's oil drop experiment? </strong></p>
Ans: Following are the importance of Millikan's oil drop experiment: (i) It shows that electronic charge is the
smallest possible charge on a charged particle or ion. (ii) It provides the evidence of quantization
of charge i.e. a body can carry an integral multiple of minimum charge i.e. Q = ne, whre n = 1, 2, 3, ... (iii) By combining the result of Millikan's experiment with the result of Thomson's experiment the mass of electron can be determined. 

<p><strong>Gases are insulators at ordinary pressures and start conducting at low pressures. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: At ordinary pressure the number of atoms or molecules is very large. Ions and electrons produced (by applying an electric field, by bombarding X-rays, y-rays etc.) are not able to move even at high voltage. These ions and electrons collide with the large number of atoms or molecules and during collision, they may lose their energies. As a result, their motion ceases and hence no electricity is conducted. Due to this reason, gases at ordinary pressure are insulators. At low pressure, the density of the gas reduces. That is the number of gas atoms present is given volume is reduced. If an electric field is applied across the gas, the ions and the electrons produced in the gas can move almost freely. Further, the accelerated electrons ionize more gas atoms. The result is that a large number of electrons move towards the anode and the same number of ions moved towards the cathode of the battery. Hence, a gas (air) at low
pressure is conductor of electricity. 

<p><strong>The value of elm is constant for cathode rays but not for positive rays. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: Cathode rays are the stream of electrons. The mass and charge of electrons are constant and hence, the specific charge of cathode rays is constant. But positive rays are stream of positive ions. Masses of positive ions are different for different substances. Hence, the value of is not constant for positive rays.

<p><strong>Write down expressions of acceleration of a moving charge Q in parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields. </strong></p>
Ans: If B is the intensity of magnetic field, v the velocity of the particle with charged Q, then the magnetic force on a charged particle is given by F = BQv sino, Where 0 is the angle between the direction of B and v. When charge Q is moving parallel to the magnetic field, i.e. 0 = 0°, then F = 0 As the charge does not experience force, it's acceleration, a = 0.

<p><strong>What are cathode rays? Write their properties. </strong></p>
Ans: Cathode rays are stream of fast moving electrons. The invisible rays, emerging normally from the cathode of a discharge tube, kept at a pressure of 0.01 mm of Hg and under a very high potential difference of the order of 10 – 15 kV, supplied from an induction coil, are called cathode rays. These rays are independent of the nature of the gas and their propagation is independent of the position of anode. Two properties of cathode rays are given below: i. They can penetrate small thickness of matter
such as sheets of aluminum foil. ii. They carry negative charge. So they are
deflected by electric and magnetic fields. 

<p><strong>In Thomson's method for determining of electron, why is the electric field kept perpendicular to magnetic What is the ratio of these fields? </strong></p>
Ans: By this method for determining electron, the electric field is ap perpendicular to the magnetic field and them are applied perpendicular to the of motion of electron beam so that the electron due to magnetic field must be opposite to the force on electron due to ition field i.e. v B e = eЕ or v = E/B. In the velocity of moving electron can be  applied Tield and both direction that the force on must be equal and
in due to electric . In this condition n can be estimated.
