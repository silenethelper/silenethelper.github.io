<p><strong>A student asserted that if a permanent magnet is dropped down a vertical copper pipe, it eventually reaches a terminal velocity even if there is no air resistance. Why should this be?</strong></p>
    Ans: When a permanent magnet is dropped down a vertical copper pipe, the magnetic flux linked with the copper pipe increases. Now, according to Lenz's law the current induced in the copper pipe opposes the motion of the magnet. Due to this, the velocity of the magnet is gradually decreases and finally reached a terminal velocity even if there is no air resistance.
    
<p><strong> What do you mean by a.c. generator?</strong></p>
    Ans: An electrical machine used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy is known as a.c. generator. It works on the principle of electromagnetic induction i.e., when a coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field, and e.m.f. is induced in it. 
    
<p><strong>What is induction heating?</strong></p>
    Ans: To heat or melt metals the heating effect of eddy currents can be used. The substance to be heated is placed in a changing magnetic field whose frequency is very high. The rapidly changing magnetic field produces eddy currents in the substance. The substance is then heated and can be melted. This kind of heating is called induction heating. This heating is generally used in extracting metals from making alloys.
    
<p><strong> Two circular loops are placed with their centres separated by a fixed distance. How would you orient the loops to have (i) the largest mutual inductance and (ii) the smallest mutual inductance? </strong></p>
    Ans: (i) Mutual inductance is largest when the planes of the two loops are held parallel to each other and (ii) Mutual inductance is smallest when the planes of the loops are held perpendicular to each other. 
    
<p><strong> A sheet of copper is placed between the poles of an electromagnet with the magnetic field perpendicular to the sheet. When it is pulled out, a considerable force is required, and the force required increases with speed. Why?</strong></p>
    Ans: When a sheet of copper is pulled out of the magnetic field, then its magnetic flux linked with the plate changes. This results in the production of eddy current and according to Lenz's law it opposes its cause.

    <p><strong> A copper ring is suspended by a thread in a vertical plane. One end of a magnet is brought horizontally towards the ring as shown in figure. Will the motion of the magnet affect the position of the ring?</strong></p>
    Ans: Yes, the ring will move away from the magnet. It is because if the N pole of the magnet is approaching the ring then the face of the ring towards the magnet will become N pole due to current induced in it (Lenz's law). Hence the ring
    will move away due to repulsion.

    <p><strong> A small resistor (say a lamp) is generally put in parallel with current carrying coil of an electromagnet. What is the use of this resistor? </strong></p>
Ans: When current in the coil is switched off, a large e.m.f. is induced in the coil. This induced e.m.f. appears across the switch contacts and may cause sparking. A small resistor in parallel with the coil provides a conducting path for the current due to the induced e.m.f. consequently
the danger of sparking operation is avoided.

<p><strong> The core of transformer is laminated,why? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: The core of a transformer is laminated to reduce the energy loss due to eddy currents. Laminations break the path of eddy currents. The energy loss due to eddy currents also results in unnecessary heating of the transformer which may be harmful for the winding of the transformer. 

<p><strong> Why is the long distance transmission of a.c. economical? </strong></p>
Ans: When a.c. flows through a transmission line, the energy loss produced in it is clearly proportional to 12 i.e. square of the current. Stepping up of a.c. raises the voltage and decreases the current and also decreases the energy loss in the line. Thus long distance transmission of a.c. becomes economical.

<p><strong>Does Lenz's law violet the law servation of energy? Explains</strong></p>
Ans: Lenz's law does not violet the law of conservation of energy. For it, consider a closed coil placed near a bar magnet north pole pointing towards the coil. As the magnet is moved towards the coil, flux linked with the coil are changed so that e.m.f. is induced and current flows in the coil. Due to it, magnetic field is produced which opposes the magnet as shown in figure. Here mechanical energy is applied to move the magnet so that e.m.f. is induced i.e. mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. Due to this induced current, magnetic field is produced which opposes the magnet. It means the electrical energy is converted into magnetic energy which is finally changed into mechanical energy for pushing the magnet. In this way energy changes from one form to another form in Lenz law and similar condition can be obtained while moving the magnet away from the coil. Hence Lenz law is in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.

<p><strong> When an inductive circuit is opened, an arc appears across the opening contacts. Why does are not appears during closing of the circuit? </strong></p>
Ans: When an inductive circuit is opened by a switch, current falls rapidly to zero and large e.m.f. is induced which appears across the switch contacts. This e.m.f. may be much higher than at of the supplied voltage and may cause spark Jump between the switch contacts. When an
inductive circuit is closed, again large e.m.f. is induced in the circuit due to rapid change of current .But now the circuit being complete, the induced e.m.f. is distributed round the entire circuit .

<p><strong>A magnet is dropped in a very copper tube. Even in the absence of resistance it acquires a consta terminal velocity. Explain why? </strong></p>
Ans: When the magnet is dropped in a coppen tube, eddy currents are produced in the tube These eddy currents produce the magnetic finla which opposes the motion of the magnet. After sometime, the opposing force becomes equal to the gravitational pull on the magnet. Thus the net force acting on the magnet is zero and hence the magnet acquires a constant velocity.

<p><strong>Mention two types of loss in a transformer. </strong></p>
Ans: Two types of loss in a transformer are as follows: 
(i) Hysteresis loss: The alternating current
flowing through the coils take the core again and again over 1-H cycles and in each cycle, some energy is lost which is proportional to
the area of the I-H loop. 
(ii) Eddy current losses: The varying magnetic
flux produces eddy currents in the iron core which also leads to the wastage of energy in the form of heat. 

<p><strong>A copper ring is held horizontally and a bar magnet is dropped through the ring with its length along the axis of the ring. Will the acceleration of the falling magnet be equal to, greater than or less than that due to gravity?</strong></p>
Ans: when the magnet approaches the ring. The magnetic flux linked with the ring increases so an e.m.f. is induced in the ring. If the ring forms a complete conducting loop, the current is also induced. According to Lenz law, the current opposes the approach of magnet: hence the acceleration of the magnet becomes less than g

<p><strong>What is Lenz's law? </strong></p>
Ans: It states that the direction of induced current is always such that it opposes the change or cause which produces it. It is used to find out the direction of current due to induced emf Note that Lenz's law is reflected mathematically in the minus sign on the R.H.S. of Faradavin second law i.e. Îµ = - dt. Here minus sign shows opposing nature of induced e.m.f.
