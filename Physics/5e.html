    <p><strong>Beta particles penetrate through matter easily than that of alpha particle of the same energy. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: The velocity of B-particles is higher than a-particles. Due to very high velocity, B-particles spend a very short time close to the atoms of medium through which they pass. Therefore, B-particles transfer much less energy to the atoms and hence have the less possibility of ionization. In this case, B-particles loose much less energy. Due to this reason, B-particles penetrate through a matter easily than that of a-particle of the same energy.

<p><strong> What percentage of a given mass of a radioactive substance will be left undecayed after five half-life periods? </strong></p>
Ans: Here, number of half-life periods (n) = 5
N 1 1 1 * No = 2n = 25 = 32 = 3.125% Hence, 3.125% of a given mass of a radioactive substance will be left undecayed after five half-life periods. 

<p><strong>Characteristic features of X-rays and gamma-rays are similar in many aspects. Write two important features that explain the differences between these rays. </strong></p>
Ans: (i) When fast moving electrons strike on a very hard target of high atomic number, Xrays are produced. But, y-rays are produced by the spontaneous emission from heavy elements in nature. If the excitation energy is not sufficient to emit further particles. It loses energy by emitting the radiation called y-rays. (ii)X-rays are penetrating but can be made refract and diffract. So they show interference, diffraction and polarization. But, y-rays are highly penetrating, they can pass even from metals. So, they cannot be made
reflect, refract and diffract. 

<p><strong>What do you mean by average life or mean life? </strong></p>
Ans: The average life or mean life of a radioactive substance is equal to the sum of total life of the atoms divided by the total number of atoms in the element.sum of life of all the atoms Mean life = total number of atoms .

<p><strong> Why do o-rays have the highest ionizing power? </strong></p>
Ans: a-particles have the highest ionizing power due to following two reasons: 
(i) It is the heaviest particle of all the three radioactive radiations. Therefore, it possesses greatest     momentum and hence can knock out an orbital electron easily. 
(ii) It is most heavily charged. Therefore,
it is capable of exerting maximum electrostatic interaction on the orbital
electron. 

<p><strong> Define roentgen, red and rem.</strong></p>
Ans: The roentgen is the unit of radiation exposure equal to that quantity of X or gamma radiation that, in dry air, produces a total ionisation of 0.333 nC per 1.293 x 10-6 kg of air. The red is a unit equal to the absorbed dose of any radiation that release 100 erg (10-5 J) of energy per gram of absorbing material. The rem is the roentgen equivalent unit for man. The rem dose is found by multiplying the dose in rads by the relative biological effectiveness (REB). 

<p><strong>Differentiate between radioactive decay and nuclear fission.</strong></p> 
Ans: Following are the difference between radioactive decay and nuclear fission:(i) Radioactive decay is spontaneous phenomenon whereas fission is not. In fission, heavy nuclei are bombarded by
neutrons. 
(ii) The rate of radioactive decay cannot be
controlled in any way but the rate of
nuclear fission can be controlled. 
iii)In radioactive decay a and ÃŸ particles
are emitted from the nucleus and the energy is obtained ion the form of y rays which is not very large. In nuclear fission a heavy nucleus is broken into two nearly equal lighter nuclei and very
huge energy is liberated.

<p><strong>The ionizing power of B-particles is less compared to a-particles, but their penetrating is more, why? </strong></p> 
Ans: B-particles, being emitted with very high speed compared to a-particles, spend very small time near the atoms of the medium. So the probability of the atoms being ionized is comparatively less. But because of the same reason, their loss of energy is very slow and they are capable of penetrating through the medium up to a much high larger distance. 

<p><strong>What is the physical significance of halflife of a radioactive substance? </strong></p>
Ans: The half life of a radioactive substance is the time after which half the original amount of substance gets decayed. For example, the half-life of 6C14 is about 5730 years. If at any instant, a piece of wood contains, say 1.0 x 1022 6C14 nuclei, then after a period of 5730 years, it will contain only 0.5 x 1022 nuclei. 

<p><strong>Why do all electrons emitted during beta decay not have the same energy?</strong></p> 
Ans: Phenomenon of B-decay arises due to conversion of a neutron in the nucleus into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino (v). Because the energy available in B-decay is shared by the electron and the antineutrino in all possible ratios as they come out of nucleus; the B-ray spectrum is continuous in nature. 

<p><strong>Is there any difference between Bparticle and the electrons emitted by photoelectricemission and the thermoionic emission?</strong></p> 
Ans: Yes, In photoelectric emission and thermoionic emission orbital electrons are emitted. Their kinetic energy is low. In the case of radioactivity, the electrons are emitted from the nucleus. During the process a neutron is converted into a proton, electron and antineutrino. B-particle travel with high velocity and hence they have high kinetic energy.

<p><strong>Radioactivity is a spontaneous phenomenon. Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: In a given radioactive sample, the life of every atom is different. It is impossible to predict, which atom will decay first which afterwards. The phenomenon of radioactive decay is purely a chance process. In other words, the decay of a particular radioactive atom is known only, when it actually decays. This is why radioactivity is called a spontaneous phenomenon. 

<p><strong>Explain, why natural radioactive nuclei are the nuclei of high mass number? </strong></p>
Ans: The B.E. per nucleon of the nuclei of high mass number is small as compared to that of the stable nuclei. Also, neutron to proton ratio of the nuclei of high mass number is different from that of stable nuclei. Such nuclei spontaneously decay to attain higher value of B.E. per nucleon and also to acquire appropriate neutron to proton ratio. 

<p><strong>Why all radio-active elements are ultimately converted into lead? </strong></p>
Ans: All those elements which are heavier than lead are radioactive. This is because in the nuclei of heavy atoms, besides the nuclear attractive forces, repulsive forces between the protons are also effective and these forces reduce the stability of the nucleus. Hence, the nuclei of heavier elements are being converted into lighter and lighter elements by emission of radioactive radiation. When they are converted into lead, the emission is stopped because the nucleus of lead is stable. The nucleus 92U288 decays to 90Th234 with emission of an a-particle with a half-life of about 4.9 x 109 years. 

<p><strong>Why is its halflife so long? </strong></p>
Ans: The average energy of an aparticle formed within a nucleus is a few MeV, while the potential barrier around the 92U238 nucleus is about 25 MeV. Classically, the aparticle cannot escape from the nucleus. Quantum mechanically, the particle has a small chance of "tunneling" through the barrier. Hence the half-life of 92U238 into 90Th234 is long. 

<p><strong>The mass of B-particles is higher than the mass of electrons obtained by other means, whereas B-particles are also electrons. Explain, why?</strong></p>
Ans: B-particles are emitted with very high velocity (up to 0.99 c). According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the mass of a B-particle is much higher compared to its rest mass (mo). The velocity of electrons obtained by other means is very small compared to c. Hence, its mass remains almost equal to mo
