<p><strong>The element of heater is very hot wire carrying current are cold, why? </strong></p>
Ans: From his experiments, joule found the the amount of heat (H) produced conductor of resistance (R) due to the flow of current I for time t second is
H = 12 Rt. or H «R, for constant current (I) and time (t) Since the element of the heater has very high resistance as compared to the current carrying wire. 
Hence large amount of heat is produced in the heater but not in the wire, even though both of them carry the same current. Due to this reason the element of heater is very hot but the wire carryis current is cold.

<p><strong>The resistance of an ammeter must essentially be very small. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: An ammeter is a low resistance galvanometer. When it is connected in series
in a circuit, the resistance of the circuit does not increase appreciably and consequently the current in the circuit remains unaffected. But if the resistance of the ammeter is high, the net resistance of the circuit becomes very high and the current in the circuit reduces and hence ammeter is not able to measure accurate current. Due to this reason, the resistance of an ammeter must essentially be very small.

<p><strong> Why is it essential that the resistance of a voltmeter be very high? </strong></p>
Ans: A voltmeter is a high resistance device. When it is connected in parallel across any component of a circuit, it draws a very small current from the main circuit. Most of the current passes through the element. Hence the p.d. across the component is not affected. If the resistance is small, the effective resistance is affected and most of the current passes through the voltmeter and the potential difference reduces across the component and the voltmeter cannot measure accurately. Due to this reason the resistance of a voltmeter be very high.

<p><strong> What happens when an ammeter is placed in parallel with a circuit?</strong></p>
Ans: When an ammeter is connected in parallel in a circuit, the resistance is considerably reduced. A large current flows through the circuit, which can damage the ammeter. Moreover, the ammeter will read the current passing through it only and not
the current in the circuit.

<p><strong> What do you mean by shunt and what are its uses?</strong></p>
Ans: A small resistance connected in parallel to a galvanometer is called shunt. Shunt is used to a. convert a galvanometer into an ammeter.
b. increase the current in a circuit. WC. increase the range of galvanometer.

<p><strong> Why do we prefer a potentiometer to measure emf of a cell rather than a voltmeter?</strong></p> 
Ans: If the potentiometer is used, it doesn't draw any current from the cell and, hence, gives the actual value of e.m.f. of the cell whereas when a voltmeter is used to measure the e.m.f. of a cell, it draws some current from the cell and, hence, it gives a reading less than the 
actual value of e.m.f. of the cell. So, the-potentiometer acts as a voltmeter of infinite resistance. Therefore, the potentiometer measures the potential difference with less error than voltmeter. Due to this reason, we prefer potentiometer to measure the e.m.f. of a cell rather than a
voltmeter. 

<p><strong> State Kirchhoff's laws of electric circuits? </strong></p>
Ans: There are two laws of Kirchhoff which are stated below. According to Kirchhoff's first law the algebraic sum of currents at a junction of an electric circuit is zero. Symbolically, I = 0 According to Kirchhoff's second law in a closed loop of an electric circuit, the algebraic sum of emfs is equal to the algebraic sum of products of currents and the resistances (or p.d.) in the various parts of the loop. That is E = sum of IR.

<p><strong> Why is Leclanche cell preferred as the driving cell in potentiometer? </strong></p>
Ans: We require a steady current for a short interval of time in potentiometer experiment. Since Leclanche cell supplies the steady current for a short interval of time. Hence Leclanche cell preferred as the driving cell in
potentiometer. 

<p><strong>What is Wheatstone bridge principle?</strong></p>
Ans: According to this principle, at balanced condition the product of the resistances of the opposite arms are equal i.e.
PR = QX
Р. X or B , where P, Q and R are known
resistors and X is the unknown resistance.

<p><strong> Manganin wire is used instead of copper wire in potentiometer. Explain why.</strong></p>
Ans: The resistivity of manganin wire is high in comparison to copper wire. But temperature coefficient of manganin wire has low value as compared to copper wire. Hence, manganin wire provides high resistance with less change in its resistance due to temperature. Due to this reasons it is used in the potentiometer wire.

<p><strong> Why do we prefer potentiometer of longer length for accurate measurement? </strong></p>
Ans: The longer is the length of the potentiometer wire, the higher is the accuracy because the potential drop on the wire per unit length decreases as the length of the wire increases. Hence the potentiometer measures
emf more accurately.

<p><strong> The sensitivity of the potentiometer wire can be increased by increasing the length of the wire. But usually we are satisfied with 10 m long wire. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: Every joint introduces some resistance which is not taken into consideration. This may introduce error in the measuremen Further it is not necessary that the wire has uniform thickness throughout its length.

<p><strong> Wheatstone bridge method determination of resistance is considered to be more accurate than the voltmeter-ammeter method. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: Wheatstone bridge method is a null deflection method. The resistance determined does not depend on the deflection of the galvanometer and the supply voltage fluctuations. So, it is more accurate than other methods.

<p><strong> Wheatstone bridge is not suitable for measuring very low resistance. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: While measuring a low resistance, all the other resistances must also be low so that the bridge is sensitive. A low resistance galvanometer is insensitive. Further, the load resistance and contact resistance will also
introduce error in the measurement.)

<p><strong> It is better to get the null point in the middle of the wire in a meter bridge. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: Because when the null point is in the . the resistances of the ratio arms are internal and the bridge is sensitive. The tances of copper strips will not affect + Hence, the measurements made
nearly equal and the bridge end resistances of copper sta the results. Hence, the me are accurate. 

<p><strong>What is meant by end-corre meter bridge? </strong></p>
Ans: The two ends of the wire coincide with the zero mark and 100 by end-correction for the
of the wire not exactly and 100 cm mark of the meter scale. Also the two ends one meter long wire need not be in contact with the copper strips at the end correction has to be applied for this. This is
called end correction.
