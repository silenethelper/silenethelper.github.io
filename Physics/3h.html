    <p><strong>What the intensity of light happens when it is polarised?</strong></p>
Ans: When the light is polarised, the jon of electric vector are restricted only plane. It means the vibrations of ctric vector in other planes are cut off. Tance the intensity of the polarised light is Tanss than that of the unpolarised light.

<p><strong>How will you verify that light coming from the sky is partially polarised? </strong></p>
Ans. We can verify this by placing a piece of polaroid sunglass in front of our eye and rotate it as we look at the sky on a clear day. We will notice a change in light intensity with the orientation of the polaroid. For a certain orientation, a dark band will appear in the sky, showing that light from the region is strongly polarised. 

<p><strong>How can one distinguish between an unpolarised light beam and a linearly polarised beam using a polaroid? </strong></p>
Ans: When a polaroid is rotated in the path of unpolarised light, the intensity of the light transmitted from the polaroid remains undiminished. However, when the polaroid is rotated in the path of plane polarised light, its intensity will vary from maximum (when the vibrations of the plane polarised light are parallel to the axis of the polaroid) to minimum (when the direction of vibrations becomes perpendicular to the axis of the crystal). 

<p><strong>What is Brewster's law?</strong></p> 
Ans: Brewster's law states that the tangent of polarizing angle is equal to the refractive index of the material i.e. u = tan Op Since, the refractive index of the material u varies with wavelength of light, so polarizing angle Op is also the function of wavelength. 

<p><strong>Is polarization possible for longitudinal waves? Why? </strong></p>
Ans: No, because they are the waves in which the vibration of the particles takes place in the direction of motion of waves. Thus the longitudinal waves are already polarized in the direction of motion of waves. Therefore, longitudinal waves are not polarized 

<p><strong>What is polarizing angle? Does it depend on the wavelength of light? </strong></p>
Ans: The angle of incidence is known as polarizing angle for which the reflected ray is completely polarized. It is represented by 0. The refractive index of a material depends on the wavelength of the light. As polarizing angle depends on the refractive index, it also depends on wavelength of the light. 

<p><strong>Is there any difference 
Ans: According to Brewster's law, the refractive index of a refracting medium with respect to the surrounding medium is given by U = tan op, where Op is the angle of polarization. We know that the refractive index of the denser medium is greater than that of the rarer medium. Hence, the angle of polarization is greater in denser medium. 

<p><strong>Does the polarizing angle for a transparent medium depend upon the wavelength of the light? </strong></p>
Ans: The angle of incidence is known as polarizing angle for which the reflected ray is completely polarized. The refractive index of a transparent medium depends upon the wavelength (2) by the Cauchy's relation,
gain we know, the polarizing angle Op = tan-1 (u).
