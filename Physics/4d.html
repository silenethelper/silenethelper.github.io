<p><strong>When a compass needle is placed on the geomagnetic north pole of the earth, then how will it behave?</strong></p>
At geomagnetic north pole, the earth's magnetic field is completely vertical and the horizontal component is zero. A compass needles on the horizontal component that shows month-south direction. The compass needle at such point will stay in any direction due to no horizontal component.

<p><strong>Can we use the deflection magnetometer in the geomagnetic poles to compare the magnetic moment? </strong></p>
Ans: A deflection magnetometer works on tangent law in which two perpendicular magnetic fields deflect a magnetic needle in proper direction. These two fields are horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field and the other is that of the magnet. Since the horizontal component is zero at the pole, the magnetometer
cannot be used in the pole. 

<p><strong>Why do we prefer soft iron for the core of transformer? </strong></p>
ans The soft iron has a small area of hysteresis loop with smaller retentavity but larger cercivity. As the core of a transformer goes tough many alternate cycles of magnetization per second, lesser energy is lost due to small loop a and high magnetic field is produced in it to high retentivity that required for a transformer.

<p><strong>A bar magnet of iron is heated to 1000c . Does it retain its magnetism on cooling?</strong></p>
The Curie temperature of iron is 750 Â°C, u above this temperature, iron loses its magnetism and turn into paramagnetic al. When it is cooled down, it cannot retain magnetism itself as the atomic moment align randomly.

<p><strong>A system showing a hysteresis loop such a ferromagnet is a device for strong memory. Why?</strong></p> 
Ans: The magnetization of a ferromagnetic material depends on the magnetizing field and on the history of magnetization. The value of magnetization of a sample is a record of the memory of cycles of magnetization it has undergone. So, such system can act as a device for storing memory.

<p><strong>What are ferromagnetic domains? </strong></p>
Ans: A ferromagnetic substance consists of many microscopic regions called magnetic domains. Each domain consists of atomic magnetic moments that aligned parallel to each other, constituting a resultant magnetic moment. However, the magnetic moments of different domains orient randomly so that resultant magnetic moment of the material is zero. Hence, ferromagnetic material is observed non magnetic in absence of applied magnetic filed. When an external field is applied, magnetic moments of domains tend to align along the applied field, resulting strong magnetic field. Saturation of magnetization is due to the complete alignment of moments of all domains in same direction. When magnetizing field is removed, there is a tendency of domain to stay they have been aligned. This results from remanance field and hysteresis effect. 

<p><strong>What is retentivity and coarcivity of a ferromagnetic material? </strong></p>
Ans: Retentivity of a ferromagnetic material is a measure of magnetism remaining in a specimen when the magnetizing field is reduced to zero. Greater the retentivity, the stronger is the magnetization of the material. The coarcivity is the reverse magnetic field needed to reduce the magnetism to zero in the material. Greater the coercive force, the better able the rod to keep its magnetization despite the presence of strong magnetic fields.

<p><strong>A paramagnetic above Curie temperature. Why? </strong></p>
Ans: A ferromagnetic material follows Curie law and the alignment of atomic magnetic moments in it is disturbed with increase of temperature. Above the Curie temperature, this alignment is completely random due to thermal motion of the atoms and the material becomes paramagnetic. 

<p><strong> Define the term magnetic dipole moment.
Ans: The product of the strength of either pole and the magnetic length of a magnet is called magnetic dipole moment. It is given by M = mx 21, where m is the pole strength and 21 is a magnetic length. It is a vector quantity and unit
is A.m2 in SI-units. 

<p><strong>What happens if a bar magnet is cut into two pieces (i) transverse to its length (ii) along its length?</strong></p> 
Ans. We get two magnets each having north and south poles in both cases. If the bar magnet is cut transverse to its length, the pole strength of niece is the same as that of the original as the length is halved, magnetic moment is also halved. If the bar magnet is cut along its strength of each piece is halu remains the same. So, magnetic halved.
If the bar magnet is cut along its length, the pole each piece is halved, but the length remain the same . So , magnetic moment is halved 

<p><strong>Two magnetic lines of force of magnet cannot cross each other. </strong></p>
Ans: A magnetic line of force is a line su the tangent at any point on it gives the dir of magnetic field at that point. If the magnetic lines of force intersect each other point, the two tangents can be drawn at that point. This would mean that there are tw magnetic fields at that point which are impossible. Due to this reason, two magnetic lines of force never intersect each other at point. 

<p><strong> Can you think of a magnetic field with three poles? </strong></p>
Ans: Yes, we obtain this with a special arrangement: bring two bar magnets such that the two north poles are attached together. Fix the two north poles using glue, and now we have a magnet with south-north-south pole. Similarly, we can construct north-south-north pole of magnet when south poles are glued together.

<p><strong> What is tangent law? Write the necessary conditions to apply tangent law? </strong></p>
Ans: If a magnet is suspended in two uniform mutually perpendicular horizontal magnet fields B and H then the magnet comes to rest ab an angle & with the direction of the field H such that B = H tan 0. This is tangent law. The necessary conditions are: (i) the two fields must be perpendicular to each other.
(ii) the fields must be uniform.

<p><strong> At neutral points, a compass needle is unable to show a proper direction ?</strong></p>
Ans: At a neutral point, the horizo component of the earth's magnetic exactly equal and opposite to the magnet of the bar magnet. So, there is no magne to align the compass needle in a proper direction, and so, the needle does not sh proper direction.
