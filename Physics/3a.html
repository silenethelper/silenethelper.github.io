<p><strong>What are nodes and antinodes?</strong></p>
Ans: Nodes are the points in the stationary wave, where the displacement of the particles of the medium is zero. Antinodes are the points in the stationery wave, where the displacement of the particles of the medium is maximum. The distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is N2, where as the distance between node and the
neighboring antinodes is N/4. 

<p><strong>Which type of wave propagates in liquid? Explain</strong></p>
Ans: For the propagation of transverse wave, the modulus of rigidity of the medium is responsible and for the propagation of longitudinal wave, the bulk modulus is responsible. A solid has both modulus of rigidity and bulk modulus but liquids have only bulk modulus. Hence longitudinal wave can propagate through the liquid. How is energy transmitted in wave motion? Ans: During wave motion, the particles of the medium are set into oscillations about their mean positions. An oscillating particle of the medium hands over its motion to a particle just ahead of it with some constant phase difference and it results in transmission of energy.

<p><strong>Longitudinal waves are pressure waves. Why?</strong></p>
Ans Longitudinal wave propagate through the medium in the form of compression and rarefaction. Propagation of longitudinal wave involves the change in pressure and volume Therefore the longitudinal waves are also
called pressure waves.

<p><strong>Is an oscillations wave ? Give reason</strong></p>
No an oscillation is not a wave. The term implies the transfer of energy through successive vibrations of the particles of the medium. So the oscillations of a body do not institute a wave and energy remains within the oscillating body. 

<p><strong>What are the main differences between sound waves and light waves? </strong></p>
Ans: The main differences between sound waves and light waves are: (i) The sound waves are longitudinal in nature but light waves are transverse. (ii) The wavelength of sound wave is quite large but wavelength of light wave is extremely small. (iii) Sound waves cannot travel through a vacuum but light waves can do so. 

<p><strong>Why sound heard better at night than at day?</strong></p>
Ans: This is due to the refraction. In the day time the upper layer of air is cooler than that of the lower layer and hence the upper layer of air becomes denser. Thus at higher temperature sound travels faster and is. refracted away from the earth. But at night the lower layer of air is cooler (i.e. denser) than that of the upper layer and hence the sound waves are refracted towards the earth. herefore, sound heard better at night than at day 

<p><strong>How are stationary waves formed?</strong></p>
Ans:  When two progressive waves of the same length and amplitude travel with the ..speed through a medium in opposite and superimpose upon each other, give rise to a wave is called stationary .They give rise to waves.In stationary waves there are certain points where the amplitude is zero. These point are known as nodes. Midway between these nodes, there are another points where amplitude is maximum. These points are known as antinodes. The formation of stationary wave along with nodes and antinodes is shown in figure. 

<p><strong>Which type of wave propagates in liquid? Explain </strong></p>
Ans: For the propagation of transverse wave, the modulus of rigidity of the medium is responsible and for the propagation of longitudinal wave, the bulk modulus is responsible. A solid has both modulus of rigidity and bulk modulus but liquids have only bulk modulus. Hence longitudinal wave can propagate through the liquid.

<p><strong>Why is a sound in a hall is louder than in the open space? </strong></p>
Ans: In a hall, from the walls and ceiling the multiple reflection of sound takes place. The reflected sound mix up with the direct sound. Due to this the intensity of sound in the hall increases. But in the open space, a faint sound is heard because no such reflection of sound takes place. Hence, sound is louder in a hall than in the open space.
