<p><strong>Why is it more difficult to revolve a stone by tying it to a longer string than by tying it to a shorter string? </strong></p>
Ans: The torque I required to produce angular acceleration & is given by t = I a,
(I = m r^2) is the moment of inertia. More is the distance of the stone from the axis of rotation, greater is its moment of inertia and hence more torque is required to produce same angular acceleration. Therefore, it is more difficult to revolve a stone by tying it to a longer string than by tying it to a shorter string</br>

<p><strong>There are two spheres of the same mass and same radius. One is solid and the other is hollow which of them has a larger moment of inertia about a diameter?</strong></p>
Ans: The moment of inertia of a solid sphere = I = (⅖)MR^2 and that of hollow sphere = (2/3)MR^2 where, m and R are mass and radius of the spheres. This shows that the hollow sphere has a greater moment of inertia than the solid sphere . It is because most of its mass is at a larger distance from the axis of rotation.</br>

<p><strong>Explain, why the speed of a whirl winds in a tornado is alarmingly high.</strong></p>
Ans: The air from the nearby regions gets concentrated in a small space inside a whirl wind. As a result the value of moment of inertia decreases by a large amount. From the law of conservation of angular momentum due to decrease in moment of inertia. th angular velocity increases alarmingly and hence the speed of a whirl wind in a tornado is alarmingly high.

<p><strong>A dancer girl is rotating over a turntable with her arms outstretched. If she lowers her arms, how does this affect her motion?</strong></p>
Ans: Moment of inertia, Ii of dancer girl when her arms are outstretched is greater than moment of inertia of the same girl when she lowers her arms. If w1 and w2 are angular velocities of the table when arms are out stretched and folded respectively, then from principle of conservation of angular momentum, we have
Since Iı > I2 so I2 > I1 It means angular speed of the turntable is increased, when she lowers her arms. On the other hand, a ballet dancer stretches her arms to reduce her motion. 

<p><strong>The cap of a bottle can be easily opened with the help of two fingers than with one finger. Why?</strong></p>
Ans: When we apply the force by two fingers to open the cap of a bottle, a moment of couple i.e. torque is produced which helps to open it easily. When we apply the force by a single finger, it cannot produce torque or turning effect or produce less turning effect and hence, be difficult to open cap of bottle. 

<p><strong>A fan with blades takes longer time to come to rest than without the blades. Why? </strong></p> 
Ans: Since moment of inertia of an object depends on its mass, the object which has higher mass has higher moment of inertin The object having higher moment of inertia takes longer time to come to rest. Here fan with blade has higher moment of inertia then without blade. Hence it takes longer time to come to rest .

<p><strong>Why in hand driven grinding machine, handle is put near the circumference of the stone or wheel? </strong></p>
Ans: For a given force, torque can be increased if the perpendicular distance of the point of apunication of the force from the axis of rotation is increased. Hence the handle put near the circumference produces maximum
torque. 

<p><strong>Why spin angular velocity of a star is greatly increased when it collapses under gravitational pull and becomes a Deutron star? </strong></p>
Ans: While collapsing under gravitational pull, the size of the star decreases. Therefore, its moment of inertia decreases. As the angular momentum (L = 10) is conserved and I decreases, the spin angular velocity o is greatly increased .

<p><strong>Can a single force applied to a body change both its translational and rotational motion? Explain. </strong></p>
Ans: Yes, when a force is applied to a body such that the body rolls without slipping on a horizontal plane surface, it rotates about the horizontal axis through the centre of mass and undergoes displacement in the forward direction. In other word, the body rotates about horizontal axis but at the same time the centre of mass of the body moves linearly forward. So, a single force applied to a body changes both its translational and rotational
motion

<p><strong>If the ice on the polar caps of the earth melts, how will it affect the duration of the day? Explain.</strong></p>
Ans: If the ice on the polar caps of the earth melts, the water (changing from ice to water), spreads on the surface of earth towards the equator. Due to this reason, the moment of inertia increases, to conserve angular momentum, the angular speed of earth decreases.
i.e. Iw = constant
or, I1w1 = constant. It gives T « I.
As moment of inertia increases, the time period increases and hence duration of day increased 

<p><strong>Experienced cooks can tell whether an egg is raw or hard boiled by rolling it a slope. How is this possible? What are they looking for?  </strong></p>
Ans: Experienced cooks can tell whether an egg is raw or hard boiled by rolling it down a slope. A raw egg has liquid inside it and hard boiled has solid. When raw egg rolls, the liquid tries to force out towards the outer walls which increases moment of inertia of the egg. But solid i.e. boiled egg has less moment of inertia) From principle of conservation of linear momentum,
Iw = Constant
