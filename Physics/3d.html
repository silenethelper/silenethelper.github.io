<p><strong>State the factor that determines (i) pitch, (ii) loudness, (iii) timber or quality.</strong></p> 
Ans: (i) Frequency of sound wave determines the pitch of sound. (ii) Amplitude of the vibrating body determines the loudness of the sound. (iii) The wave form produced by a vibrating body determines the timber or
quality of sound. 

<p><strong> A loud sound can be heard at a large distance but a feeble or soft sound cannot be heard at a large distance.Explain, why?</strong></p> 
Ans: Sound is a form of energy which is transferred from one place to another place. As sound energy is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude of a vibrating body, so loud sound has large energy, whereas soft sound has small energy. As the sound travels through a medium, sound with small energy is absorbed after travelling a small distance in the medium. Therefore, loud sound can be heard at a large distance but feeble sound cannot be heard at a large distance. 

<p><strong>Why does an empty vessel produce loud sound than that filled one?</strong></p> 
Ans: When an empty vessel is struck, it begins to vibrate and the air column in it also set in vibrations with larger amplitude. On the other hand, when the filled vessel is the liquid molecules are set in vibrations (instead of air molecules) which have smaller amplitude than that of the air empty vessel produces loud molecules. As intensity « (amplitude)2, so the filled one. 

<p><strong>Why are longitudinal way pressure waves?</strong></p> 
Ans: A longitudinal wave propagates medium by making compression to high density) and rarefaction (a lower density). Due to the all compression and rarefaction, the voluhate the medium is varied resulting the varied
vessel produces louder sound than a longitudinal waves called opagates in any ression a region of faction a region of the alternate the volume of pressure. Hence the longitud called pressure waves.
longitudinal waves

<p><strong>What are ultrasonics and infrasonics?</strong></p>
Ans: Sound waves of frequency above the audible range (i.e. above 20 kHz) are called ultrasonic waves. These sounds are not audible to normal human ears. Such waves can be generated by vibrating crystals e.g. quartz crystal. The bats can produce and hear ultrasonic waves. The sound wave of frequency below the audible range (i.e. below 20 Hz) are called infrasonic wave. The infrasonic waves are produced by the vibration of large objects. example, an earthquake waves are in waves. These sounds are not alone
normal human ears.

<p><strong>What is loudness of sound?</strong></p>
is the property by virtue of wi. loud sound can be distinguished fro one, both having the same pitch characteristic of all sounds whethe or noise. Loudness depends on amplitude of wave. Note that loud the same thing as intensity. In quantity while loud sensation.

<p><strong>Which has a more direct influence on the loudness of a sound wave: the displacement amplitude or the pressure amplitude? Explain your reasoning</strong></p> 
Ans: The intensity of sound varies directly as the square of pressure amplitude and loudness of sound is related to intensity too (though it is not directly proportional to the intensity, as it is a subjective sensation), Moreover, waves of the same intensity but different frequency have different displacement amplitude to some pressure amplitude. Hence, the pressure amplitude has a more direct influence on the loudness of a sound wave than the displacement amplitude. 

<p><strong>Is there a physical difference between intensity and intensity level of a wave? How are these quantities related?</strong></p>
Ans: Intensity (I): Yes, there is a physical difference between intensity and intensity level of wave. Intensity is defined as average rate of transfer of energy per unit area across a surface perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the sound. Mathematically,
Energy (E) Intensity (I) = Area (A) < Time (t)
It's unit is watt/m2. Intensity level (B): The difference in loudness between two sounds is called intensity level. It is measured in belt. The intensity level (B) is defined as, Intensity level ß = log10 i where, I is the intensity of sound wave and is the threshold of hearing. 

<p><strong>Why is sounding board used in a stries instrument?</strong></p> 
Ans: The stringed instruments are prov with a hollow box called sound board. W the strings are set into vibrations, 10 vibrations are produced in the sound ou Since the sound board has a large area, a large volume of air into vibrations. produces a load sound of the same free as that of the string.

<p><strong>What do you mean by Doppler's effect?</strong></p>
Ans: Whenever there is a relative motion between the source of waves and the observer,the frequency of sound received by the observer is different from the frequency of the sound waves emitted by the source. This effect is known as Doppler's effect. This effect takes place both in sound and light. In sound it depends on whether the source or observer or both are in motion. But in light it depends on whether the distance between source and observer is increasing or decreasing. 

<p><strong>Why do we have two ears? What would have happened if we have had only one ear?</strong></p> 
Ans: To identify the direction of sound and locate the position of the sounding body, the nature has provided us two ears. If we have had only one ear, we would not have been able to identify the direction of coming sound and hence estimate the position of the sounding body. 

<p><strong>How is Doppler's principle used in radar?</strong></p> 
Ans: In radar, microwaves are generated and sent out towards the target (e.g., enemy's aeroplane). The microwaves reflected by the target are received by the radar and analyzed for shift in its wavelength. If the shift is positive; i.e., if there is decrease in wavelength, there is an increase in frequency which indicates that the target is moving towards the station. If the shift comes out to be negative, there is decrease in frequency which indicates that the target is moving away from the
station. 

<p><strong>As we move away from a sounding body the sound we receive goes on decreasing. Why?</strong></p> 
Ans: According to inverse square law. The intensity (I) of sound, at a point is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) of the point from the source (I« 2). From this it is clear that as we move away from the source (i.e., if r increases), the intensity of the decreases. Due to this reason, the sound we receive goes on decreasing as we move away from the source.

<p><strong>In a machine run saw, high is heard initially and low pitch s heard after some time. Explain</strong></p> 
Ans: In a machine run saw, sound is produce produced when the saw teeth strike against When the wood just touches the saw teeth to friction between the saw teeth and the w a very high pitch sound is generated. . However , if the wood is pressed hardly against the sa the speed of rotation of the saw decreases. A result, the pitch of the sound produced by th striking of the teeth with the wood goes do Hence, in a machine run saw, high pitch som is heard initially and low pitch sound later on .
