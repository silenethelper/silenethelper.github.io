<p><strong>Explain the significance of second law of thermodynamics. </strong></p>
Ans: The second law of thermodynamics simply mesures the direction of heat flow, i.e. heat always flows from a body at higher temperature to the body at lower temperature and heat never flows itself from a body at lower temperature. The second law of thermodynamics, according to; KelvinPlanck Statement: It is impossible to get continuous supply of work from a body which can transfer heat with a single source of heat. Clausius Statement: It is impossible to make heat flow from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature without doing external work on the working substance.

<p><strong>Why does a refrigerator consume more power in summer than in winter to cool the same quantity of food by same degree?</strong></p> 
Ans: A refrigerator is a heat engine which extracts heat from a cold body and rejects to hot body by doing work in working substance. Higher the temperature difference between hot and cold body, more energy is required to do work by the refrigerator. In summer, temperature difference is higher so that high energy is required to cool by the refrigerator in summer than winter. Hence, a refrigerator consumes more power in summer than in winter to cool the same quantity of food by
same degree of temperature. 

<p><strong>Is it possible to construct a heat engine that creates no thermal pollution? </strong></p>
Ans: According to Kelvin-Planck statement of second law of thermodynamics, we say that th working substance of a heat engine, operatin in a cycle cannot convert all the extracted heat in to work. A part of the heat must be rejected in to the sink at a lower temperature which causes thermal pollution. Due to this reason, it is impossible to construct a heat engine that
creates no thermal pollution. 

<p><strong> Write down the statements of second law of thermodynamics. ?</strong></p>
 Ans: The second law of thermodynamics can be stated in different ways. Kelvin's Statement: According to Kelvin, the second law of thermodynamics can be stated as follows: “It is impossible to get a continuous supply of work from a body by cooling it to a temperature lower than that of its surroundings.” According to Clausius, the second law of thermodynamics can be stated as follows: "It is impossible for a self acting mach unaided by any external agency to covey from one body to another at ang temperature i.e. we cannot make heat from a colder body to a warmer body wil
doing external work.

<p><strong></strong>Why is conversion of heat into work not possible without a sink at lower temperature?</strong></p>
Ans: For converting heat energy into work continuously, a part of heat energy absorbed from the source has to be rejected. The heat energy can be rejected only if there is a body, whose temperature is less than that of the source. This body at lower temperature is the sink.

<p><strong>A gas expands adiabatically and reversibly, what is its change in entropy?</strong></p>
Ans: In an adiabatic process no heat enters or leaves the system. Hence dQ = 0 and there is no change in entropy in its reversible process, AS = 0. So, every reversible adiabatic process is a constant entropy process. That's why the reversible adiabatic process is also called a isentropic process. The increase in disorder resulting from the gas expansion is exactly balanced by the decrease in disorder associated with lower
temperature and reduces molecular speed. 

<p><strong>Why an engine cannot achieve 100 percent efficiency? </strong></p>
Ans: If Q1 is the amount of heat absorbed from the source and Q2 be the heat rejected to the sink, then the efficiency of the heat engine is given as Since Q1 > Q2, the efficiency, n is always less than unity. Hence the efficiency of heat engine cannot be 100%. For 100% efficiency n = 1, so that Q2 = 0 which is impossible according to the second law of thermodynamics. Therefore an engine cannot achieve 100% efficiency.

<p><strong>Can a room be cooled by leaving the doors of an electric refrigerator open in a closed room? </strong></p>
Ans: The room cannot be cooled by leaving the door of an electric refrigerator open. A refrigerator is a heat engine that operates in the reverse direction i.e. it extracts heat from a cold body and transfers it to a room which is at the higher temperature. Hence the temperature of room will not be cooled down but the room gets heated slightly. 

<p><strong>Petrol engine is less efficient than diesel engine. Explain why?</strong></p>
 Ans: During the ignition of the fuel work is not obtained in petrol engine; however there is work done during the ignition for diesel engine. Further in case of diesel engine compression ratio is more than that of petrol engine. Hence the petrol engine is less
efficient than diesel engine. 

<p><strong>Why does diesel engine need no spark plugs? </strong></p>
 Ans: In a diesel engine, the air is compressed adiabatically until its temperature rises about 700 °C. when a spray of diesel oil is injected into the cylinder of the engine, the diesel oil burns producing a large amount of energy. Thus, no spark plug is needed for diesel engine.
