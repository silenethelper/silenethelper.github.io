<p><strong>Why specific heat capacity of gas at constant pressure is greater than its specific heat capacity at constant volume? </strong></p>
Ans: Cp and Cy are molar heat capacities at constant pressure and at constant volume respectively. According to first law of thermodynamics, the amount of heat given to a system is equal to the sum of the change in internal energy and work done in the system i.e. dQ = dU + dW. If one mole of gas is heated at constant volume, work done is zero and hence, supplied heat is utilized in raising the temperature of gas. i.e., internal energy. However, if one mole of gas is heated at constant pressure, the gas expands and hence, performs some work. That is, a part of supplied heat is utilized to raise the temperature and a part to perform work. Thus, greater amount of heat is required to raise the temperature of one mole of gas by 1 Â°C at constant pressure than at constant volume. Mathematically Cp = CV + R, Since R> 0, Cp > Cv. Therefore, Cp is greater than Cv.

<p><strong>How does internal energy of a system change during adiabatic process? </strong></p>
Ans: Internal energy is the function of temperature. During adiabatic compression, temperature of the system increases and hence internal energy also increases. During adiabatic expansion, the temperature of the system decreases and hence the internal energy of the system also decreases.

<p><strong>Why has a gas two values of molar heat capacities? </strong></p>
Ans: If a gas is heated at a constant volume, the heat supplied is used to rise the internal energy only and so, temperature of the gas increases. But if the same gas is heated at a constant pressure, (the supplied heat is used to rise the internal energy and the external work done. So, the more amount of heat is required to rise the temperature through the same amount.)Due to this reason, a gas has two values of molar heat capacities.

<p><strong>Milk is poured in to a cup of tea and is mixed with a spoon. Is this an example of reversible process? </strong></p>
Ans: When milk is mixed in tea, certain amount of work is done on the system which appears in the form of heat. With the recovery of same work from heat the milk can not be separated from tea. Therefore, this process is not reversible. 

<p><strong>A cylinder filled with a gas is being carried inside a fast moving train, what change will be there in the internal energy of the gas? </strong></p>
Ans: As the cylinder is kept within the train, the whole gas moves as bulk and there is no relative motion between the gas molecules. So, vibration of gas molecules filled in the cylinder is not possible. Due to this reason, temperature of the gas does not change. 

<p><strong>>When an electric fan is operated in a closed room we feel cold. Why? Is there any fall in the temperature of the room? </strong></p>
Ans. The motion of air molecules increases as we operate the fan in a closed room. The motion of the air molecules increases the rate fevaporation of sweat from our body. In this ase heat is taken out from our body and reiected into the room, so that we a slight rise in temperature due cold. There is a slight rise in temper to the motion of the molecules of the evaporation of sweat from our body the room. Therefore, there is fall in temperature of the room.

<p><strong>Why does the temperature of a gas drop during an adiabatic expansion?</strong></p>
Ans According to first law of thermodynamics, the wount of heat given to the gas is equal to the I the change in internal energy of gas done by the gas i.e. dQ = dU + dw. labatic expansion, dQ = 0, i.e., dU e, internal energy of the gas is used to internal work. So internal energy decreases. The internal energy of the system is function of temperature, the decrease internal energy means decrease in temperature.
