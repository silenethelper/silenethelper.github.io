Short Questions-Answers 
Q.16. What is a rate constant? Define half-life period and show that half-life period does not depend upon the initial concentration of the reactants for first order reaction. 
Q.17. What are the important factors affecting rate of a chemical reaction?
Q.18. For a given reaction A + B  → products , the following data were obtained in three different runs of experiments.

Long Questions-Answers 
Q.19. (a) Define the terms:
     (i) First order reaction (ii) Rate law (iii) Effective collision (iv) Activation energy (v) Half-life period of a reaction
     (vi) Instantaneous rate. 
     
    (b) From the following experimental data for the reaction.
     2 A + B → 2 AB 

Q.20. What do you understand by the rate of a reaction? How is it
expressed? What is the usefulness of initial rate method? The rate law for a reaction A → B is given as, Rate = K[A]^m  
From the following data, determine the order of the reaction with respect to A. Also calculate the value of rate constant (K). 
Initial concentration of A (M). Initial rate (M/s) 
    0.05                             3 x 10^-5
    0.10                             12 x 10^-5 
    0.20                             48 x 10 

Q.21. What is the rate law of reaction? How does order of a reaction differ from molecularity of a reaction? Rate of reaction A + B → P is given below as a function of different initial concentration of A and B.

Q.22. Define instantaneous rate of a reaction compare the rate of      reaction of all the components of the following reaction:
             2 N2O5(g) → 4NO2(g) + O2(g); 
Find the rate of each component in mol s, when 22.4L of O, at NTP are produced in 30 minutes.
