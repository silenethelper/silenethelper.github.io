Short Questions-Answers
Q.14. How is a suitable indicator selected for a particular titration? Q.15. 2.1 g of a sample containing NaOH and Na2CO3, was dissolved in water and solution was made upto 250 mL. A 20 mL of this solution required 40 mL of NVIO H SO, for complete neutralization. Calculate the percentage weight of NaOH and Na2CO3. 
Q.16. What is meant by titration error? In a titration of 20.0 mL of aquous solution of NaOH with 0.10 N HCl, the observed end point is 22.7 ml, whereas the equivalence point is 22.5 mL. Calculate the percentage error in the mass of hydrochloric acid per litre of the analyte for this titration. 
Q.17. How does a decimolar solution differ from decinormal solution. 20cc of an alkali solution is mixed with 8.0cc of 0.75N acid solution and for complete neutralization, it further required 15cc of 0.8N acid solution. Find the strength of the given alkali solution.
