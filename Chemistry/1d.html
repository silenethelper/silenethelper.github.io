State Hess's law of constant heat summation. 
Define First law of thermodynamics. 
Point out the limitations of Ist law of thermodynamics? Define enthalpy. 
Derive the relationship between enthalpy change and entropy change on the basis of first law of thermodynamics. 
Differentiate between enthalpy and internal energy. 
What are meant exothermic and endothermic reaction? 
Calculate the enthalpy of formation of NH3, from the following equation. N2(g).+ 3H2(g) + 2NH3(g), AH = -186 kJ.. Calculate the enthalpy of combustion of nitric oxide from the following data:
NO; AH = + 90.37 kJ
(8), AH = -186 kJ..
N2 +0, - NO2; AH° = +33.89 kJ 
Q.10. Calculate the change in internal energy. When 2 moles of CO are
converted to 2 moles of CO2 at 1 atm and 25°C.
1 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) AH = -566.0 kJ mol! 

Q.11. For the decomposition CaCO, (s)
Cao(s) + CO2(g) at 950°C, AH is 176 kJ mol!. Assuming that the volume of the solid phase changes very little, calculate AE for the decomposition. ,
